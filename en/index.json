Using data from adults in Germany (N = 29,355) assessed between October 2021 and February 2022, we investigated factors associated with self-reported compliance in both private and working life and how these relate to each other. The results indicate that private compliance was stronger among older individuals and females; among those who worried more about the pandemic situation and assumed that infection was more severe; among those who trusted the government more; and among those who did not perceive public health measures as exaggerated. Private compliance was also associated with personality traits; in particular, individuals who followed regulations and recommendations were likely to be more introverted, conscientious, open, and agreeable. Compliance at work related to both private compliance and colleagues' behaviors. Individuals whose private compliance was high also complied at work. However, when private compliance was low, compliance at work aligned with colleagues’ behaviors; that is, compliance at work was high when colleagues complied and low when they did not. The observed effects were stable over time. In summary, they suggest that compliance with regulations and recommendations depends on individual risk perception, trust in government, perception of required or recommended measures, and social norms. To promote protective behaviors in contexts where larger groups gather (including workplaces), making positive social norms more salient (e.g., by supporting role models) may prove especially useful.","tags":[],"title":"From delta to omicron: The role of individual factors and social context in self-reported compliance with pandemic regulations and recommendations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Datenspende Vital Data Explorer maps the aggregated and averaged vital data over time and across regions.\nHere’s how it works:  On the left side, you can see two input fields above the timeline.

The row below lets you enter the district-level regions you want to investigate (or simply click on them on the map). For example, you can compare your local area with the national average. Click on the play button to the left of the timeline to activate automated time progression. This allows you to see how the values develop over time. Below the timeline, you will find a miniature view of the entire timeline. Draggable bars at the ends enable you to zoom in on a specific period of interest. The map is interactive. Hovering the cursor over a region or state will show you the local 7-day average. You can zoom in on a location by scrolling the mouse wheel, or by pinch-to-zoom.

Bruckmann","Hannes Schenk","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Heart rate","Activity","Sleep","Tools"],"content":"Dear Donors,\nAbout a year ago, we were able to take stock of the first year of Datenspende. Today, around 470 million donated data points on heart rate, step count and sleep provide us with a unique insight into the development of vital signs under pandemic conditions.\nTo give you a glimpse into our data analysis process and the amount of work that has gone into this project, in this article we touch upon some of the challenges we’ve faced over the course of two years of data donation. We further introduce you to a new tool for exploring these vital signals for yourself.\nWhat we were able to show last time In May 2021, measurement data from 2020 and 2021 were available for the same month for the first time. This marked a major milestone for our analyses: we were able to explore what insights can be gathered from this year-to-year comparison. In this blog post, we demonstrated some of the interpretations we were able to draw. For example, the weight gain of many people during the COVID-19 pandemic could be an explanation for the observed increase in resting heart rate during the year. Weather may also have a considerable influence on heart rate and activity patterns. However, one thing has become clear from many of our analyses to date: your donated data cannot just be analyzed independently, but must always be evaluated in the context of external, possibly interconnected circumstances.\nWhat is possible now? A year ago our scope was relatively limited. At that time, we were only able to compare the month of May across two years - a month that already tended to be associated with declining case numbers following the end of the winter waves since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. For periods with more prevalent infectious activity, we lacked year-to-year comparative values. Thanks to your donations, comparing for example seasonal influences (e.g. low temperatures and longer nights in winter) is now becoming viable. But: there are many more possible influences and signals that can be found in our data - and we want to give you the opportunity to take a look for yourself.\nTwo years at a glance The data donation project spans an enormous range of widely diverse events, such as New Year’s celebrations, school holidays, major sporting events such as the European Football Championship and the Olympic Games, but also COVID-related mobility restrictions or the latest summer heatwave. All these events are reflected in our records, with for example heat waves affecting heart rate, New Year’s celebrations altering sleep patterns, and winter months decreasing the step count of our data donors, even when roughly summarized regionally and temporally.\nOur analytics team studies new aspects of the dataset every day, and we want to actively share this process with you. Over the past few weeks, we have developed a tool to interactively visualize the vital data geographically over time: The Datenspende Vital Data Explorer. The data is averaged over a seven-day period and aggregated at least on a district level, ensuring that conclusions about the specific patterns of individual data donors are not possible. Today, we are excited to share with you a prototype of this data explorer tool. The tool is currently not optimized for mobile devices and will be constantly developed further. In case the visualization does not load right away, simply select select a data set or hit ‘Play’ to get started.\n How does it work? The Datenspende Vital Data Explorer maps the aggregated and averaged vital data across time and space. We summarized the key features for you below:\n On the left side, you can see two input fields above the timeline. The first box lets you choose the data set of interest - either heart rate, step count or sleep duration. The row below lets you enter the district-level regions you want to investigate (or simply click on them on the map). For example, you can compare your local area with the national average. Click on the play button to the left of the timeline to activate automated time progression. This allows you to see how the values develop over time. Below the timeline, you will find a miniature view of the entire timeline. Draggable bars at the ends enable you to zoom in on a specific period of interest. The map is interactive. Hovering the cursor over a region or state will show you the local 7-day average. You can zoom in on a location by scrolling the mouse wheel, or by pinch-to-zoom. Last but not least: Beneath the map you’ll find a legend attached, explaining the distribution of colors on the map. Here an additional switch enables you to choose between displaying federal state level or certain counties.  What can be explored? Basically everything. Using the example of Christmas 2021, we will show you what can be found in our data. In the period from 12/24/2021 to 12/31/2021, the average heart rate increased by almost a whole beat per minute.

How we assess the risk of infection, the methods we use to protect ourselves, and how we handle the pandemic in the future all depend on the answer to this question.\nFor several weeks now, Germany has been discussing a potential underreporting of its COVID-19 incidence rate. While more and more testing centers are closing due to lower summer demand, wastewater sample analysis and respiratory infection monitoring systems indicate increasing case rates. According to the current case definition, the reported 7-day incidence is based exclusively on PCR test results, while rapid antigen tests, whether performed professionally or at home, are not considered. Compared to rapid tests, PCR tests are often more accurate and ensure that local outbreaks can be detected correctly with a high degree of certainty. If the PCR test volume decreases, relative trends will still be visible, but the magnitude of new infections will be much more difficult to estimate.\nVarious research approaches are attempting to describe this degree of underreporting more precisely. Using questionnaire data from 28,274 data donors, in which we recorded test results and test types (e.g. PCR test, rapid antigen test), we aim to better estimate this situation by adding another piece to the puzzle.\nWhat does our data show? Our analysis consists of two steps: first, we compare how the official 7-day incidence differs from the “data donation” incidence based on your reported test results. Next, we examine PCR test rates over time to determine if a decline of this number is evident in our population and assess how it affects infection dynamics.\nTo get our analysis going, we first need to calculate the data donation incidence. For each day, we divide the number of self-reported positive tests via our App by the number of questionnaires submitted that day. From this, we calculate the 7-day average and multiply the result by 100,000. This enables us to estimate the number of cases per 100,000 donors and approximately compare our values to official statistics.\n   echarts4r (function() { // If window.HTMLWidgets is already defined, then use it; otherwise create a // new object.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate. Such long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data was collected over a period of two years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around 190,000 monthly active donors. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals on average experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research.","tags":[],"title":"Evidence for positive long- and short-term effects of vaccinations against COVID-19 in wearable sensor metrics: Insights from the German Corona Data Donation Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Heart Rate","Long COVID"],"content":"Dear Donors,\nFor almost two years now, your data has helped us to better understand the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this, we would like to thank you once again.\nDuring this time, we have learned that there is a great willingness to support science and research with health data from fitness trackers and smartwatches. Over 500,000 people have donated their vital data for at least a certain period of time and more than 38,000 people already regularly participate in our in-app surveys. Using your data, we were able to capture anomalies in vital data that is potentially related to COVID-19 symptoms and the frequency of those detections in the fever monitor maps well to the pandemic’s waves of infection.\nKeeping an eye on the long-term consequences of the pandemic In 2022, we are expanding the focus of our research and examine the long-term health consequences of COVID-19. In the coming months, we would like to investigate, among other things, how physical activity, sleep, fitness and mental health develop in individuals after the disease.\nFor this reason, we will launch a new study on Long COVID in the data donation app which is developed in close collaboration with the Long COVID group at the Robert Koch Institute. By answering monthly questionnaires, you will help us to understand potential long-term changes in vital signs after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, to determine the frequency of long-lasting or emerging symptoms, and also study the interaction between the two.\nNew research questions thanks to comprehensive vital data From your donated data we have already gained important insights into the potential changes of vital signs following the acute phase of COVID-19. In one of our recent blogposts, we were able to show that the average daily resting heart rate in COVID-19 positive individuals is elevated for months following an infection and normalizations may only happen slowly (Fig. 1).\n   Figure 1: Average change in daily resting heart rate for COVID-19 positive individuals regardless of vaccination status using data until October 2021. Details on the calculation and results can be found here.  Similarly, in preliminary analyses, we found that vaccinations can have a strong positive effect on the normalization of vital signs after contracting COVID-19 (Fig. 2). You can also find these results in one of our recent blogposts.\n   Figure 2: Average change in resting heart rate (weekly aggregates) for COVID-19 positive individuals who bt the time of infection were either unvaccinated (red) or at least fully vaccinated (purple). Results are based on data collected until January 2022. Full details about this analysis are found here.  From here, there are many other questions that we want to look at in the following months and that you can help us understand better. This includes, among others:\n What are the long-term effects of pandemic-related behavior change on the health-related quality of life? How long do people have diminished physical or mental capacity after being sick with COVID-19? How much do Long COVID symptoms, such as fatigue (persistent exhaustion), affect the activity and sleep patterns of recovered people?  Study starts on April 4, 2022 The new Long COVID study is expected to be available in the Data Donation app on April 4. All donors will be notified via push notification once participation is open. New donors can find the app in the app stores of Google, Apple, and Huawei. To sign up for the study, you need to first add the study via the main menu, and then elect to participate.\nThe monthly questionnaires will only take a few minutes to complete. Already now, we like to thank all donors for their continued participation and support. As usual, we will share our results with you in this blog on a regular basis.\nIf you have not yet participated in our other sub-studies (Test, Symptoms and Life Situation and Experience and Behavior in the Pandemic), we would like to invite you to participate in these surveys as well.

For example, each week we ask how much our donors trust the federal government to properly handle the pandemic. The responses are measured on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely) and a total of 29,530 donors already submitted their responses. Since we recently received a request about this question according to the freedom of information (IFG) act we would like to share some information on that topic with you today.\nTrust varies with case numbers The following figure shows the mean daily responses over time. It can be seen that the average trust our donors have in the federal government has overall been moderate, i.e. between mostly and partially, with the main exception of November and December 2021. Average trust declined steadily with the increase of new infections in November, followed by a resurgence of trust in December when case numbers fell again. However, when the number of daily new infections increased again in January 2022 due to the Omicron variant, average trust in the federal government declined only slightly and levelled out with the reduction in case numbers in February 2022.

See end of this text for details.\nDatenspende 2.0 is finally here. Since mid-October you can answer short questionnaires in the app to help us to substantially improve our understanding of the donated vital data in relation to COVID-19. More than 12,000 people have already taken part and entrusted us with this information. For this we would like to express a heartfelt thank you right away.\nFor instance, in the ‘Tests, Symptoms \u0026amp; Life Situation’ questionnaire, we ask donors about the approximate time and result of their first PCR test. A total of 521 donors reported having a positive test in the past, 5353 donors submitted a negative result.\n  \nIf we look at how often self-reported positive results occurred over time, you can see that this distribution fits very well with the course of the pandemic. We see the first wave in March 2020, the second and third wave in winter 2020/2021 and the fourth wave starting now. Conversely, we observe few positive test results in the summer months.\nProlonged changes in vital signs for COVID-19 positive individuals If we look at the physiological and activity data before and after a PCR test, we obtain interesting insights into the possible effects of COVID-19 infections. In particular, we calculate the mean change in resting heart rate, step count and sleep duration relative to the baseline period before the test, for both positively and negatively tested donors.\n  \nLet’s first look at the resting heart rate. For donors with a confirmed COVID-19 infection, this value increases by an average of 2 beats per minute prior to getting tested. This is followed by a brief normalization period, which has been observed in a previous study, before spiking again and then slowly returning to baseline levels over an extended period of two to three months. In contrast, donors who tested negative show no significant changes over time. The shaded regions represent the so-called confidence intervals that indicate the uncertainty of the mean.\n  \nWhen we look at activity patterns (measured by daily step counts), the influence of COVID-19 is even more pronounced. In the days preceding a positive test result, step counts begin to drop sharply, reducing activity by around 3500 steps per day on average. That’s equivalent to a decline of more than 50% of usual activity! This change lasts for up to a month.\n  \nSleep duration is also affected by COVID-19. Around the time of diagnosis, our COVID-19 positive donors sleep an average of around 40 minutes more, which also takes about three weeks to return to normal.\nFor all three variables, similar findings have been reported in a comparable study of donated vital data in the United States. This shows that our results are by no means an exception, but are instead consistent with the current state of research.\nImproving the fever algorithm The donated data suggests that COVID-19 can produce prolonged changes in physiological and behavioral signals, particularly in the case of resting heart rate. Next, we will investigate this phenomenon in more detail and use these new findings to improve and validate our fever detection algorithm. In doing so, we will also take into account effects such as sociodemographics and life circumstances.\nIn one of our first blogposts we already discussed that the demographics of our donors are not fully representative of Germany’s general population and particularly senior citizens, one of the major risk groups for COVID-19, may be underrepresented in the data donation project. Thus, our observed effects may be even more pronounced than what we currently obtain from the donated vitaldata. Additional demographic information that we collect in the second questionnaire of the study ‘Tests, Symptoms \u0026amp; Living Situation’ should therefore help us to extrapolate the effects observed in the vital data more accurately to the whole population in the future . We would like to thank all donors for their continued support in our efforts to better understand COVID-19 through providing us with wearables data as well as entrusting us with vital personal information obtained via the questionnaires. We will continue to keep you informed of further progress here and report new insights made possible by the surveyological data as they become available.\nCorrection In an earlier version of the blog post we discussed a maximum change in resting heart rate of up to 3 beats per minute and a return period of up to three months. Likewise, a prolonged sleep duration of 60 minutes was reported. After writing this arcticle, we have improved our calculation to specifically account for seasonal influences, such as altered resting heart rate in winter, and increased activity as well as reduced sleep in summer. To make the results comparable to those in our later blogpost on breakthroughs infections, we adjusted the figures in this blogpost on April 11, 2022 by using our improved algorithm.

This time we compare the educational level, the subjectively assessed health status and the utilization of general medical services of the participants in the sub-study with reference data. This brings us another step closer to the goal of describing data donors more precisely. Data donors in the sub-study are not representative of the general population, they registered themselves with the data donation app without having been randomly selected. This means that differences between the data donors and the general population are to be expected. We would like to further investigate in this blog post how strong these differences are with regard to the indicators mentioned.\nWhy do we compare the data donors in the sub-study with reference data? What does this have to do with Covid-19?\nThe comparison tells us whether the results of the questionnaire or the fever monitoring can be generalized to the overall population. Or, to put it another way, whether the effects that we record in the fever monitor would be expected to be less pronounced or more pronounced compared with the general population.\nEducational status To assess the educational background of the participants in the sub-study, we choose the Microcensus 2017 as a reference (source: FDZ der Statistischen Ämter des Bundes und der Länder, DOI: 10.21242/12211.2017.00.00.1.1.1, own calculations). For this purpose, we classify the educational and vocational training into three categories (low, medium, high education) according to the standards of ISCED11. When comparing educational status between participants of the sub-study and the Microcensus 2017, large differences can be seen in all three educational groups. As known from other surveys (i.e. survey study of the general population), we also see here that participants of the sub-study with low education are strongly underrepresented compared to the Microcensus 2017. This means that fewer people with low education participated in the sub-study than you would find in the general population. Also, from the group of those with a medium education, fewer people participated in the sub-study than would have been expected according to the Microcensus 2017. In contrast, significantly more people with a high level of education took part in the sub-study than would be expected in the general population. If we look at the distribution of education according to gender and age groups, we see similar results. There are stronger differences among women than among men. Moreover, the difference increases with age.\nLimitation: The distribution from the Microcensus 2017 refers to the population aged 18 and over. The data donors, on the other hand, can participate from the age of 16. In the 16-18 age group, a large proportion has not yet completed their school education. This proportion was assigned to the low education category. The proportion in the low education category would therefore actually be even larger if the distribution of the population aged 16 and over were considered. Unfortunately, we do not have this distribution. 16 (0.08 %) data donors did not provide any information on school-leaving qualifications and vocational training out of a total of 20,924 participants in the questionnaire “Living situation” (Last updated: 20.12.2021).\n    Total by Gender by Age    //options Chart.defaults.font.size = 15; var labels_chart = [ \u0026#39;low\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;middle\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;high\u0026#39;, ]; var ds = [ {y:1.8,yMin:1.6,yMax:2.0}, {y:34.9,yMin:34.3,yMax:35.6}, {y:63.3,yMin:62.7,yMax:64.0}, ]; var ds_men = [ {y:1.7,yMin:1.4,yMax:2.0}, {y:41.6,yMin:40.5,yMax:42.8}, {y:56.7,yMin:55.6,yMax:57.9}, ]; var ds_women = [ {y:1.8,yMin:1.6,yMax:2.1}, {y:31.6,yMin:30.8,yMax:32.4}, {y:66.6,yMin:65.8,yMax:67.4}, ]; var ds_1 = [ {y:5.0,yMin:4.2,yMax:6.0}, {y:40.5,yMin:38.5,yMax:42.6}, {y:54.5,yMin:52.4,yMax:56.6}, ]; var ds_2 = [ {y:1.1,yMin:1.0,yMax:1.3}, {y:34.7,yMin:34.0,yMax:35.5}, {y:64.1,yMin:63.4,yMax:64.9}, ]; var ds_3 = [ {y:1.4,yMin:1.1,yMax:2.0}, {y:31.5,yMin:29.8,yMax:33.2}, {y:67.1,yMin:65.3,yMax:68.8}, ]; var geda19 = [ {y:17.5}, {y:57.3}, {y:25.2}, ]; var geda19_men = [ {y:14.0}, {y:56.3}, {y:29.6}, ]; var geda19_women = [ {y:20.9}, {y:58.3}, {y:20.8}, ]; var geda19_1 = [ {y:21.0}, {y:61.6}, {y:17.4}, ]; var geda19_2 = [ {y:13.4}, {y:57.4}, {y:29.2}, ]; var geda19_3 = [ {y:22.2}, {y:55.1}, {y:22.7}, ]; let legend_Blog2_isced11en = 1; const chart_Blog2_isced11en = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;chart_Blog2_isced11en\u0026#39;).getContext(\u0026#39;2d\u0026#39;); const chart__Blog2_isced11en = new Chart(chart_Blog2_isced11en, { type: \u0026#34;barWithErrorBars\u0026#34;, data: { labels: labels_chart, datasets: [ //####DS //ds 0 { data: ds, label: \u0026#39;Sub-study\u0026#39;, backgroundColor: \u0026#34;rgba(102,205,170, 0.2)\u0026#34;, borderColor: \u0026#34;rgba(102,205,170, 1)\u0026#34;, borderWidth: 1 }, //ds men 1 …","date":1640044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640044800,"objectID":"1c2e45a1bac0382a9272b3dce21555be","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.de/en/reports/benchmark/","publishdate":"2021-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/benchmark/","section":"reports","summary":"Introduction In this blog post, we will give you further insight into the socio-demographic characteristics and the health situation of the data donors in the sub-study “Tests, Symptoms and Living Situation” (hereafter referred to as “sub-study”).","tags":["Sociodemographics","Benchmark","Sample"],"title":"Comparison of data donors in the substudy on 'Tests, symptoms and living situation' with other reference studies","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Johannes Lemcke","Daniel Grams","Ilter Öztürk","Ronny Kuhnert"],"categories":["Sociodemographics"],"content":"Introduction In previous blogposts, we have already discussed the sociodemographics and spatial distribution of donors.\nIn this blogpost, we will again look at the sociodemographic composition and spatial distribution of donors. For the analysis, we will look at two selection levels each and compare them with the actual population composition (Census update, as of 12/31/2019). To do this, we look at sociodemographic and spatial distribution using three variables: spatial distribution at the state level (classified using the first three digits of the given zip code), gender, and age (recorded in categories of 10). In the first group, the data of the self-report at new registration of all data donors are analyzed, in the second group the data of the sub-study “tests, symptoms and living situation”. We would like to investigate two questions:\n How much does the current sample of all individuals participating in the Data- Donation-App deviate from the true distribution in the population? How much do donors who participated in the “tests, symptoms, and living situation” sub-study differ from the overall donor sample?  Regional Distribution In order to map the regional distribution of donors, we first look at the postal code of the donors. We assign these to the corresponding federal state. For reasons of data protection, we only collect the first three digits of the donor’s postal code (and thus no longer give a distribution at the county level). If we compare the spatial distribution within the federal states with the true distribution in the population (Figure 1, bar chart), we see different participation rates in the federal states. In the states of Hamburg and Berlin, we see that donors are disproportionately represented relative to the population distribution. For example, the value 0.41 of Hamburg indicates that, compared to the distribution in the population, about 40 percent more people from Hamburg are represented in the data donation sample than would be expected according to the population distribution in Hamburg. On the other hand, the states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony are clearly underrepresented. This distribution is also reflected when we look at all donors per 100,000 inhabitants per federal state (Figure 1, Map of Germany).\n   .one { //margin-top: -20px; width: 50%; height: 380px; float: left; }  //bula all var map1 = { ni: 406.7, sh: 411.7, be: 440.3, mv: 206.6, hb: 363.5, sl: 312.9, by: 325.2, th: 205.6, st: 183.7, sn: 217.5, bb: 278.0, nw: 409.4, bw: 320.9, he: 397.4, hh: 499.3, rp: 351.1 } jQuery(\u0026#39;#map1\u0026#39;).vectorMap({ map: \u0026#39;germany_en\u0026#39;, backgroundColor: \u0026#39;rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.0)\u0026#39;, borderColor: \u0026#39;white\u0026#39;, borderOpacity: 0.25, borderWidth: 2, // colors: colors, enableZoom: false, hoverColor: false, hoverOpacity: 0.7, normalizeFunction: \u0026#39;linear\u0026#39;, scaleColors: [\u0026#39;#ddeaf5\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#0275d8\u0026#39;], selectedColor: false, selectedRegions: null, showTooltip: true, legend: { horizontal: true, cssClass: \u0026#39;jvectormap-legend-icons\u0026#39;, title: \u0026#39;Business type\u0026#39; }, values: map1, onLabelShow: function (event, label, code) { if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Niedersachsen\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Lower Saxony\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Schleswig-Holstein\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Schleswig-Holstein\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Berlin\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Berlin\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Mecklenburg Western Pomerania\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Bremen\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Bremen\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Saarland\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Saarland\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Bayern\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Bavaria\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Thüringen\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Thuringia\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Sachsen-Anhalt\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Saxony-Anhalt\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Sachsen\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Saxony\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Brandenburg\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Brandenburg\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Nordrhein-Westfalen\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Northrhine-Westphalia\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Baden-Württemberg\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Baden-Württemberg\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Hessen\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Hesse\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Hamburg\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Hamburg\u0026#39;;} if(label[0].innerHTML ==\u0026#39;Rheinland-Pfalz\u0026#39;) {label[0].innerHTML =\u0026#39;Rhineland Palatinate\u0026#39;;} label.append(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;+map1[code] + \u0026#39; data donors/100k\u0026#39;); } }); label=[\u0026#39;Lower Saxony\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Schleswig-Holstein\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Berlin\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Mecklenburg Western Pomerania\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Bremen\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Saarland\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Bavaria\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Thuringia\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Saxony-Anhalt\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Saxony\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Brandenburg\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Northrhine-Westphalia\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Baden-Württemberg\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Hesse\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Hamburg\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Rhineland Palatinate\u0026#39;]; data=[ 0.15, 0.17, 0.25, -0.42, 0.03, -0.12, -0.08, -0.42, -0.48, -0.39, -0.21, 0.16, -0.09, 0.12, 0.41, -0.01]; const labels_ = label; const data1_ = data; // Construct and array of objects that have \u0026#39;label\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;data\u0026#39; // We expect that labels and data1 are the same length but if there is // a chance that they are not, you should check for that. …","date":1638403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638403200,"objectID":"5887b60f3bdcaf1f9d7492023cdba592","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.de/en/reports/fragebogenteilnehmer/","publishdate":"2021-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/fragebogenteilnehmer/","section":"reports","summary":"Introduction In previous blogposts, we have already discussed the sociodemographics and spatial distribution of donors.\nIn this blogpost, we will again look at the sociodemographic composition and spatial distribution of donors.","tags":["Sociodemographics","Sample structure","Tests, Symptoms \u0026 Life Situation"],"title":"Demographics of the donors in the 'Tests, symptoms and living situation' study","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Heart rate","Sleep","Activity"],"content":"Note: Updated on April 11, 2022. See end of this text for details.\nDatenspende 2.0 is finally here. Since mid-October you can answer short questionnaires in the app to help us to substantially improve our understanding of the donated vital data in relation to COVID-19. More than 12,000 people have already taken part and entrusted us with this information. For this we would like to express a heartfelt thank you right away.\nFor instance, in the ‘Tests, Symptoms \u0026amp; Life Situation’ questionnaire, we ask donors about the approximate time and result of their first PCR test. A total of 521 donors reported having a positive test in the past, 5353 donors submitted a negative result.\n  \nIf we look at how often self-reported positive results occurred over time, you can see that this distribution fits very well with the course of the pandemic. We see the first wave in March 2020, the second and third wave in winter 2020/2021 and the fourth wave starting now. Conversely, we observe few positive test results in the summer months.\nProlonged changes in vital signs for COVID-19 positive individuals If we look at the physiological and activity data before and after a PCR test, we obtain interesting insights into the possible effects of COVID-19 infections. In particular, we calculate the mean change in resting heart rate, step count and sleep duration relative to the baseline period before the test, for both positively and negatively tested donors.\n  \nLet’s first look at the resting heart rate. For donors with a confirmed COVID-19 infection, this value increases by an average of 2 beats per minute prior to getting tested. This is followed by a brief normalization period, which has been observed in a previous study, before spiking again and then slowly returning to baseline levels over an extended period of two to three months. In contrast, donors who tested negative show no significant changes over time. The shaded regions represent the so-called confidence intervals that indicate the uncertainty of the mean.\n  \nWhen we look at activity patterns (measured by daily step counts), the influence of COVID-19 is even more pronounced. In the days preceding a positive test result, step counts begin to drop sharply, reducing activity by around 3500 steps per day on average. That’s equivalent to a decline of more than 50% of usual activity! This change lasts for up to a month.\n  \nSleep duration is also affected by COVID-19. Around the time of diagnosis, our COVID-19 positive donors sleep an average of around 40 minutes more, which also takes about three weeks to return to normal.\nFor all three variables, similar findings have been reported in a comparable study of donated vital data in the United States. This shows that our results are by no means an exception, but are instead consistent with the current state of research.\nImproving the fever algorithm The donated data suggests that COVID-19 can produce prolonged changes in physiological and behavioral signals, particularly in the case of resting heart rate. Next, we will investigate this phenomenon in more detail and use these new findings to improve and validate our fever detection algorithm. In doing so, we will also take into account effects such as sociodemographics and life circumstances.\nIn one of our first blogposts we already discussed that the demographics of our donors are not fully representative of Germany’s general population and particularly senior citizens, one of the major risk groups for COVID-19, may be underrepresented in the data donation project. Thus, our observed effects may be even more pronounced than what we currently obtain from the donated vitaldata. Additional demographic information that we collect in the second questionnaire of the study ‘Tests, Symptoms \u0026amp; Living Situation’ should therefore help us to extrapolate the effects observed in the vital data more accurately to the whole population in the future . We would like to thank all donors for their continued support in our efforts to better understand COVID-19 through providing us with wearables data as well as entrusting us with vital personal information obtained via the questionnaires. We will continue to keep you informed of further progress here and report new insights made possible by the surveyological data as they become available.\nCorrection In an earlier version of the blog post we discussed a maximum change in resting heart rate of up to 3 beats per minute and a return period of up to three months. Likewise, a prolonged sleep duration of 60 minutes was reported. After writing this arcticle, we have improved our calculation to specifically account for seasonal influences, such as altered resting heart rate in winter, and increased activity as well as reduced sleep in summer. To make the results comparable to those in our later blogpost on breakthroughs infections , we adjusted the figures in this blogpost on April 11, 2022 by using our improved algorithm.

Whether these changeovers are useful, unnecessary or even harmful is widely debated - both in terms of personal preference and public health. After all, numerous studies have shown that in the short term, the changeover can disturb one’s routines and well-being. In the long term, the changes influence when and how much sunlight we get in our daily lives. This can have a variety of effects on our bodies and psyche, in part mediated by changes in our sleep.\nTherefore, today, we take a look at the sleep data of our donors during the last two clock changes.\nDaylight saving time, summer time, standard time, what time?   Fig. 1: Shift in sleep timing between DST and winter time. Shown is the average daily midsleep time over the full course of the Data Donation - measured in local time (top) and in standard time (bottom). The weekly peaks reflect the later sleep on weekends, the large central peak is caused by New Year’s Eve. Looking at the bottom graph one can see that sleep is essentially almost an hour earlier during DST. The top graph shows that sleep in local time appears nonetheless slightly later because the shift in sleep timing is not exactly a full hour.  Standard time, the time in effect during the winter months, is the regular time in our time zone. For Daylight Saving Time (DST), also called summer time in some regions, the clocks are then set forward by one hour, meaning we pretend that it’s already one hour later or that we live in a time zone further east.\nSo DST means that work and schools essentially start one hour earlier. And most of us react to this by shifting our sleep forward.\nThis shift is also quite obvious in our donors’ data: measured in standard time, their midsleep, the midpoint between falling asleep and waking up, was on average almost one hour earlier during DST than during standard time (Fig. 1, bottom). Looking at the same pattern in local time (Fig. 1, top), however, you can hardly make out a difference between summer and winter. Hardly? Indeed, because a closer look reveals that the shift in sleep did not fully compensate for the one-hour clock change, so that sleep during DST appears on average a few minutes later (Fig. 1, top).\nThe 2021 spring changeover - unusual pattern during unusual times? Normally, the spring changeover is the “more difficult\u0026#34; one. When we change from standard time to DST, we usually “lose” an hour of sleep, since work or school starts essentially an hour earlier from then on.\nThis spring, however, the changeover seems to have been quite smooth on average (Fig. 2): Although the donors slept less on the night of the changeover, the following 2-3 weeks they slept actually more than before. This is unusual, because previous studies have shown that the first week of DST is usually marked by sleep loss in the majority of people.\n  Fig. 2: Sleep duration around the start of DST. Shown in purple is the sleep duration over 4 weeks before and after the changeover. The solid line shows the daily value, the dashed line the mean value over several weeks before and after. Apart from the shorter sleep on the Sunday of the changeover (compare with the expected duration in red), there is an unusual increase in sleep duration after the changeover to DST - probably driven by the Easter vacations following the changeover and the pandemic situation at that time.  What was going on in Germany in the spring of 2021? Easter break started directly after the changeover in 3 federal states and one week later in nearly all others. In addition, there were the Easter holidays themselves and the third Corona wave during which the home office rate was 24-31% according to surveys. Maybe that’s why some of the donors didn’t have to get up a whole hour earlier after all?\nA look at the wake-up times supports this hypothesis (Fig. 3): the donors woke up “only” 40 minutes earlier on average in the 3 weeks after the changeover - probably because a significant part of them did not have to adapt immediately and completely to DST.\n  Fig. 3: Wake-up times around the start of DST. Shown in blue is the wake-up time over 4 weeks before and after the spring changeover. The solid line shows the daily value, the dashed line the mean value over several weeks before and after. Wake-up times became essentially earlier with the start of DST (standard time, dark blue), but at first only by half an hour, making wake-up later in local time (DST, light blue). This suggests that some of the donors did not (have to) adapt to the new time and explains the unexpected increase in sleep duration after the change illustrated in Fig. 2.  The fall changeover 2020 - later is earlier? In the fall, we get back the hour that we “lose” during the spring. Work and schools start an hour later again, so most people can get up …","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"333c13a2eab33d24bd7d9a97dbc075a4","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.de/en/reports/clockchange/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/clockchange/","section":"reports","summary":"This weekend it’s that time again: The clocks will be changed back one hour, from daylight saving time to standard time.\nSince the beginning of the Corona Data Donation, this is the third clock change.","tags":["Sleep"],"title":"Clock change","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["App update"],"content":"Dear donors, After several months of preparation, it is finally here: Corona Data Donation 2.0, through which you can participate in scientific studies on the consequences of the Corona pandemic as of today. In these studies, we will regularly ask you to answer short questionnaires on specific topics, voluntarily of course.\nThe app update is available from the Google Play Store if you have an android phone, from the Apple App Store if you are on iOS, as well as from the Huawei App Gallery.\nBy updating to Corona Data Donation 2.0, we want to allow you to participate more directly, improve the data on which our scientific work is based, and create a way to evaluate the results so far.\nSupport science you find important The update initially unlocks two studies in the app, and we are already working on more in the background. It is important to note that we will only offer you studies in which we see a clear added value, and that participation always remains absolutely voluntary.\nThe first study “Tests, symptoms and living situation” will help us to further improve the algorithms of the fever monitor, as well as to detect possible signs of long covid disease in the data. Participants:in the study will be asked to provide further information on socio-demographic characteristics, health status and behavior in questionnaires. These data will also help us understand which groups are participating in the data donation project - and which may not. In the second study, “Experience and Behavior in the Pandemic,” we are collaborating with the COSMO study scientists led by Cornelia Betsch to understand individual exposure and risk perceptions, as well as individual behavior in the pandemic.\nBetter science thanks to better data Using data from the surveys, such as if and when you had a covid infection, or were vaccinated, we can improve our results in two ways.\nThe first is to evaluate and improve previous results, for example, detections in the fever monitor. For the detections, we use our algorithm to look at a person’s vital signs - resting heart rate and step count - and estimate whether a Covid disease might have been present during the period under consideration. With your help we can compare the result of this estimation with the result of the survey - and check directly how well our algorithm works.\n  window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig:

rate","Activity"],"content":"Dear Donors,\nFor the past year, our fever monitor has compared two distinct signals: The detections of anomalous vital signs and weekly incidences of COVID-19. Both signals have unique advantages and disadvantages when it comes to monitoring current trends of the pandemic:\n The incidence curve describes the overall state of the pandemic very well, but due to lags in reporting of numbers, is only really reliable up to a couple of days in the past. Our fever curve instead can provide a real-time monitoring (with no reporting-lags) of current physiological and physical stress, but also picks up on other signals not necessarily related to COVID-19, such as acute respiratory diseases, including influenza-like illnesses, or even changes in weather conditions.  A nowcast based on vital-signs Today, we explore how to exploit the advantages that come with both sources of information for a short-time monitoring of the pandemic’s current state. Specifically, we encompass the history of the pandemic through the detection rate of anomalous vital signs and the (reliable) incidences from the previous week. Combining this historic information with the current detection rate thus potentially enables us to provide a so-called nowcast of COVID-19 incidences.\nBelow, you can see a first comparison of our proposed monitoring system with later confirmed incidences.

This is a significant milestone, because it allows us to draw longitudinal conclusions from the data and share those with you.

of you donates not only their daily heart rate and steps but also their sleep data, particularly how long and when you sleep. Since sleep provides a wealth of information on health and well-being, we are now taking a closer look at these data - enlisting also the expertise of sleep researchers.\nOur analysis of the sleep data has two main aims: First, we would like to understand how sleep is changed under the pandemic - because of lockdowns, home office and psychological burden or distress. We hope that this will provide indications about general well-being and health during the pandemic as well as side effects of pandemic measures. Second, we want to further improve our fever monitor based on the sleep data. Someone who is acutely sick usually sleeps more than before. We seek to make use of this effect in our real-time monitoring of COVID-19 cases in Germany.\nIn this blog post, we would like to introduce the sleep data in general.\nHow do we sleep? Sleep has multiple dimensions. Among those most easily measurable are sleep duration and sleep timing. Sleep duration refers to how long one sleeps; sleep timing refers to when one sleeps i.e. the midpoint between first falling asleep and the final wake-up. Both sleep duration and sleep timing change with age and differ between women and men. This is also the case in the data from the donation-data:\nSleep duration Sleep duration: You can see that young donors sleep on average the most and with increasing age, sleep gradually shortens. Across most ages, women sleep slightly longer than men. The group showing the shortest sleep duration are 60-year-old men with 6h 59 min. In contrast, the group of 20-year-old women sleeps on average half an hour longer at 7h 30min.\n  Sleep timing Who is the most pronounced night owl, can fall asleep only late and has trouble getting up in the morning? No surprises here: the teenagers and young adults show the latest sleep timing also in the donation-data (shown is the sleep timing on weekends). With increasing age, sleep becomes earlier and earlier, so owls slowly transform into larks. Generally, men tend to be more owlish than women i.e. sleep later. The earliest midsleep time is exhibited by 70-year-old men at 03:40. In contrast, the latest midsleep time, over one hour later, can be seen in 20-year-old men at 04:50. If one assumes a fixed sleep duration of 8 hours, a young man would sleep on average from 00:50AM to 08:50AM on his weekends, whereas a man well advanced in years would sleep rather from 11:40PM to 07:40AM.\n  Sleep timing is regulated by a body clock - set by light When and how we sleep is not our free decision but subject to strong biological regulation. Our body clock, also called circadian clock, provides our body with an internal time-of-day: during the biological night, our body is programmed for sleep, during the biological day, it is programmed for wakefulness. The circadian clock is mainly set by light - the best and strongest light for synchronisation is sunlight.\nThe donation-data show quite nicely that our sleep is indeed influenced by sunlight. There is a clear pattern from East to West in sleep timing. In the East, where the sun rises and sets earlier, people sleep earlier on their free days (weekends and holidays) than in the West, where the sun rises and sets later (around 4 min per longitude).\n  The cities stand out from this pattern: Here, sleep timing is significantly later than in the surrounding, less populated areas. Several studies indicate that this is at least partly due to lower daylight exposure in densely populated areas. A weaker light signal leads to a delay in the circadian clock and thus also in sleep timing. If opportunities for evening leisure activities also play a role is not clear, however, during pandemic times, there are much less such opportunities…\nThe town Sömmerada in Thuringia shows the earliest sleep timing with an average of 03:12. The people in the city of Mainz in North Rhine-Westphalia sleep almost a full hour later with an average of 04:11. For this comparison, however, one needs to take into account also the differing demographics between the regions.\nLiving and sleeping in 2 time zones: jetlag at home without any travel Much stronger than the East-West pattern, however, is the workday-weekend pattern in sleep timing. This can be seen also in the plot of the daily sleep timing in the donation-data: on weekends, donors slept not only longer but also much later than during the week.\n  The strong weekly pattern shows also interesting deviations: on public holidays in May and June, and most strongly over Christmas and New Year’s. As expected, the latest mid-sleep time was on January 1st at 05:29 after New Year’s celebrations. The earliest sleep timing was found at 02:47 on the day after the change from Daylight Saving Time to standard time at the end of October. This means a difference of 3 hours in average sleep timing across the year!

However, until now the Fever Monitor has continued to deviate from the case counts starting around the beginning of the new year. In this post, we will try to explain why we think this happened and introduce to you our updated algorithm.\nWhat happened? To recap: The Datenspende fever detection algorithm uses resting heart rate and daily step count data from fitness-tracking devices to identify patterns that are characteristic of fever symptoms. We know that increased resting heart rate in addition to decreased physical activity can be indicative of fever, so our algorithm is designed to establish baseline levels of these metrics for every individual and detect deviations from them. When a person’s resting heart rate is significantly elevated at the same time that their daily step count is significantly decreased relative to a threshold defined by how much their measurements tend to vary, a detection is triggered. The fever monitor represents the overall rate of detections across all users over time.\nBecause fever is one of the core symptoms of COVID-19, the official case counts have been the primary point of reference for our fever detection curves. However, the goal of the data-donation project algorithm is to provide an estimate of the current fever incidence in the population, not to replicate the COVID-19 case counts. Fever can be caused by other illnesses, such as the flu and respiratory infections. However, the strong, observed deviation can not be explained by other sources of fever alone.\nThe influence of weather During the summer of 2020, a sudden heatwave caused an initial decrease in heart rate followed by a large spike, while activity levels remained rather stable. This challenged the algorithm because the baseline period was defined as a few weeks beforehand. After the drop in heart rate, suddenly all measurements were way above their baseline. Now, it seems the other way around. After a sudden drop in heart rate and activity levels following the start of the lockdown, step counts have been gradually increasing since the beginning of the year, while the resting heart rate has been relatively unchanged. Take a look at the averages over time:\n   The average resting heart rate over time    The average step count over time \nTo fix our summer anomaly, we implemented both a normalization to combat abnormal weather effects as well as a longer baseline period for the heart rate. Why the longer baseline period? With the short baseline, brief deviations due to external factors significantly affect this baseline, which, overall, is relatively stable, as you can see in the figure above. Then why are we facing this problem now?\nWhat was the problem? In the figure showing the step count over time, you can see a long sine wave pattern corresponding to the different seasons. Our longer baseline doesn’t work in this case because, in the winter months, everyone tends to have a lower step count, which, as stated above, is one of the key factors of our algorithm. These changes aren’t due to abnormalities, but a distinct seasonal change spanning multiple months. Thus, if we compare this week’s step count to the one you had 3 months ago, you will likely see a strong deviation. But what if we only looked a few weeks back? This would give a more accurate idea of one’s current activity levels and be able to better detect quick deviations from it.\nBetter tracking of covid-19 case numbers So we changed exactly that. We shortened the length of time for computing the baseline for step count while keeping the long baseline for heart rate. We also put a stronger weight on heart rate, as it is our primary measure and our detections should reflect this. As a result, the fever detection algorithm no longer is affected by external conditions and now aligns much better with the COVID-19 case counts:\n    \nWe keep improving The data-donation project is the first of its kind, so it has a strong experimental component and requires occasional improvements of underlying algorithms. In the weeks to come, we expect that additional modifications of the algorithm will become necessary as we refine our methods more and more. Some of you have noticed we removed the individual curves for the federal states. We took this step because we wanted to focus on correcting the trend for the nationwide curve first. We still have the plan to provide regional curves in the future again, but we probably have to aggregate some of the lower population states. If under a certain limit of donors per region, the detection rate turns out to be skewed and does not provide the necessary level of information we intend to share.\n","date":1614729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614729600,"objectID":"d3c22912c880343678bbb3f8e7f277bc","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.de/en/reports/improved-method-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/improved-method-2/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear donors, since the middle of December, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany until the end of February.

Noteably, the curves now appear smoother, without the charactistic up-and-down modulations that were previously seen on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The reason behind this change is that we are now using an improved version of our fever detection algorithm for the Monitor.\nDuring the past weeks, we have been working hard to refine the detection algorithm. One of our key goals was to account for the impact that weather and temperature have on heart rate and activity, and subsequently the performance of the algorithm, by removing the influence of seasonal variations.\nBecause the COVID-19 case counts in Germany follow the improved fever detections substantially better, we would like to take the opportunity to share in what ways we improved the algorithm.\nDetektions and Case Counts First, let’s have a look at the case counts compared to the detection curves for Germany and its federal states identified by the improved algorithm.\n

See blog post “How does it work?” for the mechanics of how the whole thing works and the basic idea behind it, or check out some of the preliminary results we obtained in the past.\nIn the context of the current covid-19-pandemic this is important because fever can be one of the symptoms of covid-19. So, if we detect an increase in the proportion of donors with potential fever symptoms this might be an indicator that covid-19 infections are on the rise as well.\nBut does it work? One way to check this is comparing the time course of the new daily confirmed covid-19 cases in Germany with the estimated cases of fever in the community of donors that we detect and compute with our algorithms. If both curves have similar shapes as a function of time, if they follow similar “ups” and “downs”, it is an indication that it works.

In this post, we not only want to give you an update on the national fever curve, but also want to show the results we obtained for the individual federal states in Germany.\nRecall: In this project, we evaluate the time series of daily averages of resting heart rate and daily step counts of individual donors. When, if compared to individual baseline values in both quantities, the resting heartrate increases and remains elevated for a few days while simultaneously the step count drops and remains low for the same number of days, that anomaly is an indication that a person is sick and has developed a fever.

When we conceived and launched the project about three months ago we thought that we could use the daily donations of resting heart rate and daily step count to detect the onset of fever in donors which in turn would help us quantify changes in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic because fever is a symptom of the infection. Details of the underlying scientific idea were discussed in the blog post How does it work?.\nAlthough the task is straightfoward conceptually, the devil is in the detail. We had to perform a whole series of performance tests, check the algorithms, optimize parameters of the detection, deal with gaps in the data, make sure confounding factors, like climate, weather, holidays, and weekly modulations of the donors’ vital signals, geographic variation, etc. wouldn’t skew the results. Many of the necessary analyses were discussed in previous posts and lead to interesting scientific findings that were initially outside of the scope and intention of the project.\nWell, today we share with you the first solid results concerning the detection of fever in Germany based on the Corona Data Donation Project.\nWe computed the first fever curve. The results below are still preliminary and they may change in the future as we optimize the detection algorithm. But it’s safe to say now, we believe, that we are “seeing a signal”. This whole thing seems to be working.\nWhat signals are we looking for? Let’s recap what we are after: Many donors have donated long stretches of daily resting heart rate and daily step count data by now. For every donor we would like to detect deviations from their normal values. For example a sudden increase of resting heart rate and persistence over a few days could be a fever symptom. So first we need to determine the “normal” values, the so called baseline. In order to get a viable baseline we need quite a number of days of data because naturally all vital signals are fluctuating.\nOrdinary baseline behavior   window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig:

the goal of the Data Donation Project?

Many of these things can influence the vital data of our donors; for example, lifted lockdowns, bank holidays and good weather may lead to more sport activity and could potentially lead to a high resting heart rate.\nOne of the big challanges of this project is the identification and correct handling of those numerous other factors.\nA good example of a factor that might influence vital data is weather.\nWhat do we expect? The weather influences the vital data on multiple levels. On one hand can good weather change our behaviour. If donors are more active on days with good weather, this should influence their step counts in particular. So far it’s just common sense.\nOn the other hand it is known from previous studies, that temperature has a direct influence on our heart rate. At pleasant room temperature our heart rate is the lowest. If we’re cold or sweating, our heart rate increases slightly.\nOf course the outdoor temperature is not necessarily the temperature that our body directly experiences.\nRain and Clouds Lead to Less Activity Weather, of course, has many aspects: temperature, precipitation, wind speeds, cloudiness, and many more. Their influence on the vital data is diverse.

Together with the resting heart rate, the step count is an important parameter for this study. As you can read in our post, The Pulse of the Nation, deviations from the average resting heart rate could indicate fever. However, resting heart rate may also deviate for various unrelated reasons.\nBy taking the step count into consideration as well as the resting heart rate, we can obtain a stronger indicator for fever: If your daily step count is much lower than your average step count, while your resting heart rate is significantly higher than baseline, it is more likely that fever is the underlying culprit. Thus, we obtain stronger results when combining step count and heart rate in our analysis.\nHowever, before combining both parameters into one analysis, the step count itself needs to be analyzed on its own. By doing this, important variations due to weekday patterns or weather factors can be identified first. Moreover, step counts may even vary regionally between rural and urban areas. Taking all this into consideration, we aim to establish a solid reference baseline for further analyses.\nStep count statistics for Germany and the federal states To determine the typical daily step count and variation of donors in Germany, we plotted the the distribution of average daily step counts for all of Germany and each of the federal states:\n  window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig:

Since an increased heart rate could be a possible indicator for fever, which alone is a core symptom of COVID-19, the resting heart rate marks the basis for this study. More on this topic can be found here.\nEach day, every connected device delivers information about a donor’s resting heart rate. By collecting this information for a number of days, we can establish a baseline resting heart rate for each donor. Because these values vary under normal conditions, we calculate this reference baseline on an individual-basis. This way, as we receive more and more data, we will be able to detect sytematic deviations from a normal resting heart rate that is unique to each person.\nThe distribution of the average resting heart rate Because resting heart rate is our reference point, we need to better understand how this value varies amongst our donors. In short, what is “normal”?\nThe figure below depicts the distribution of the average resting heart rate over all donors. It shows that values vary roughly between 40 and 90 beats per minute.\n  window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: \u0026#39;local\u0026#39;};   window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {}; if

Regional biases, for instance, need to be identified and considered in further analyses. Moreover, we must ensure that enough donors are registered in each district so that statistical evaluations are valid and the anonymization gained through the regional consolidation is guaranteed.\nThe donors in Germany As of (16.06.2021), 538.174 donors have successfully registered their fitness wearables with our Corona Donation App. That is an average of 1.304 donors per district.

We are working to get a better understanding of the spread of the coronavirus in Germany.\nYour fitness information is measured and pre-processed by your fitness device, sent as anonymized data packages to the Corona Data Donation App and thereby made accessible to us for analysis.\nThe collected information could help us identify indicators of COVID-19 symptoms. By merging your information with other data sources, e.g. official registration data, we can paint a better picture of how the virus may spread.\nHow does it work? Sensors, like accelerometers, temperature and optical sensors, are built into your fitness tracker to determine health and fitness related activity. The Data Donation App collects this information and stores it safely and anonymously on our server, allowing us to access the crowd-sourced data.\nA key measurement in our analyses is the resting heart rate, which describes how often your heart beats within one minute when you are at rest.\nMultiple times a day, your resting heart rate is derived by your wearable device from several measurements. By looking at these measurments over time, we can determine your baseline average resting heart rate, which may vary from person to person. However, if your measured heart rate is significantly or temporarily higher than your baseline average, it could be due to fever, which is one of the key symptoms of COVID-19.\nOf course, an elevated heart rate is not necessarily indicative of fever. Physical activity also causes an increase in heart rate. Therefore, we will analyze activity data, such as daily step count, along with resting heart rate.\nMoreover, the duration and quality of sleep can be derived using the combination of motion sensors and pulse detectors. Changes in sleep behavior can also be used to identify symptoms of COVID-19 infection.\nAll in all, by combining information from multiple sensors, we may be able to draw scientific conclusions that increase our understanding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWho invented it? The idea described above is certainly nothing new.\nAn article, “Harnessing wearable device data to improve state-level real-time surveillance of influenza-like illness in the USA: a population-based study”, published in January, 2020 in The Lancet journal, describes the use of wearables for detecting fever and identifying the spread of influenza.\n","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"c00b84f0f03e96625698dd3416ea88ab","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.de/en/reports/how/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/how/","section":"reports","summary":"By registring your wearable fitness device to the Corona Data Donation App, you are directly contributing to currently ongoing research.
