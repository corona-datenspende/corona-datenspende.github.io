Bruckmann","Annika Rose","Christian Puta","Marc Wiedermann","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Heart Rate","Experience and Behavior"],"content":"As we already know from past analyses, the average resting heart rate of an individual deviates from baseline levels following a COVID-19 infection. Often the resting heart rate takes several months to return to its baseline. In this blog post, we further investigate how this systematic change in heart rate relates to the number of COVID-19 symptoms experienced.\nThe Resting Heart Rate’s Role in Cardiovascular Wellness Your resting heart rate (RHR) measures heart beats per minute when the body is relaxed and inactive. It is an important indicator of not only cardiovascular, but overall health, reflecting both long-term and acute biological stress, as well as lifestyle and fitness. For healthy adults over the age of 18, RHR should range between 60 and 100 beats per minute, depending on factors such as physiological condition. However, a resting heart rate lower than 60 is not necessarily a cause for concern – it can also indicate good physical fitness. People who are physically active have stronger heart muscles that are able to pump more blood with each contraction, meaning the heart beats less frequently and more efficiently, which is reflected in a lower RHR.\nWhen your RHR chronically exceeds normal levels, it may be a sign that your body cannot handle physical stress as well as it should. This can be attributed to various lifestyle behaviors, such as insufficient or inconsistent exercise, high levels of daily stress, lack of sleep or poor sleep quality, smoking, drinking, or unhealthy diet.\nThese behaviors can reflect a gradual increase in RHR. However, if your RHR suddenly increases far beyond its baseline, the root cause is usually found in acute health conditions. Among the main reasons: Infectious diseases.\nHow infectious diseases put strain on the heart When a pathogen (e.g., a virus) attacks the front lines of our innate or adapted immune defense, the body undergoes severe stress. Viruses hijack the host’s cellular machinery and use it to replicate and spread inside the organism, triggering a resource-hungry inflammatory response that increases the heart’s workload. As SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to heart muscle cells, cardiac injury can occur on a direct pathway too, for example as a result of inflamed heart muscular tissue. To defend against these processes, special messengers of the immune system called cytokines cause the body temperature to rise - an effective way to weaken pathogens: Higher temperatures can efficiently slow down their ability to multiply while triggering heat-sensitive cellular mechanisms that boost the immune response.\nHowever, increased temperatures can also be dangerous for the body, especially in the very old and the very young. To prevent severe damage, thermoregulation mechanisms are capable of cooling down the body again - for example by increasing the amount and speed of blood flowing to and within the skin, allowing more heat to be lost over the skins surface. For this whole process to work, more blood has to flow through the skin again causing more strain on the heart.\nNow, suppose the body also has less water available, for example, due to vomiting or diarrhea. As a result the blood thickens, making it more difficult to transport. At the same time, acute respiratory infections reduce the amount of oxygen being taken in, causing low levels of oxygen in the blood and, subsequently, to the vital organs which can in some cases be life-threatening.\nIn short, the more symptoms that occur simultaneously, the greater the increased workload, and the greater the overall burden on the heart. That’s where our data comes into play.\nHow we can measure this increased strain Through weekly questionnaires, users of the data donation project reported an array of symptoms associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as positive and negative PCR test results. Along with wearable-derived data, we investigated how the RHR changes that occur with COVID-19 infection differ with the number of symptoms reported, using the number of symptoms as a proxy indicator for the intensity of the disease.\nIn this analysis, we averaged individuals’ daily RHR values for 1.5 months before the active infection period and compared this baseline to the highest RHR peak recorded within a detection window of 4 days before and 10 days after the reported test result. This peak deviation is then compared to the symptom count.\nBelow, you can see how the peak change in RHR (relative to an individual’s baseline) increases monotonically with an increasing number of symptoms reported during the week of a positive PCR test. For now, we will only focus on people who have reported at least one symptom (so-called symptomatic cases). We will further investigate the resting pulse behavior in asymptomatic records separately in the future.\nFig. 1: The more symptoms reported (horizontal axis), the greater the difference between the pre-infection baseline and resting heart rate peaks during the infection period (vertical …","date":1701302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701302400,"objectID":"f0f24ac50c5d4e60d2c46801146e1301","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/rhr-symptom-count/","publishdate":"2023-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/rhr-symptom-count/","section":"reports","summary":"As we already know from past analyses, the average resting heart rate of an individual deviates from baseline levels following a COVID-19 infection.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term changes in personal health and health-related wellbeing after a SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a subject of debate. Such effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration around a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data were collected over a period of 2 years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with around 190,000 monthly active participants. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals, on average, experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large-scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research.","tags":[],"title":"Evidence for positive long- and short-term effects of vaccinations against COVID-19 in wearable sensor metrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert W. Bruckmann","Philipp Sprengholz","Marc Wiedermann","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Erleben und Verhalten"],"content":"Pharmaceutical interventions, especially vaccinations, are considered a reliable partner in the fight against infectious diseases. However, before such tools are even available (and also supportive beyond that), other interventions take effect where the transmission takes place: At the human behavior. In situations where there is a particular risk of infection, protective measures such as mask wearing and keeping a physical distance of at least 1.5-m limit the risk of transmission in the long term (Chu et al., 2020).\nHowever, many factors determine whether a person actually engages in appropriate protective behavior. In a journal article published in Social Science and Medicine (Sprengholz et al., 2023), we use survey data from 29,355 data donation participants to examine which characteristics alter behavior in the private domain, and how social environments affect behavior in the workplace.\nFive reasons why people protect themselves the way they do People who purposefully avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2 do so for a variety of reasons. The following five factors are particularly important for individual decisions:\nHow likely do I consider an infection for myself? How dangerous would that be for me? And how serious is my concern about contracting the virus? Can I easily implement the protective behavior? Do I trust the institution issuing recommendations for protective behavior? Individual personality traits: Am I more likely to be conscientious and willing to compromise, or not? Does my behavior violate social rules in the groups that surround and matter to me? The last point carries particular weight for infection control, because people can exhibit protective behavior here even if they do not expect to benefit directly themselves. In our article, we examined the reasons in more detail and tested them statistically in a step-by-step manner. Here, we summarize the most important results for you.\nThose who are more likely to follow rules and recommendations in their private lives … according to our data, tend to be older, female, worry about infection, find it rather difficult, show increased trust in the federal government and perceive measures as appropriate for pandemic control. People are also more likely to be introverted, agreeable, open to new experiences, and conscientious. While these factors continue to apply in the workplace, one key component also plays a major role: the social environment.\nColleagues influence one’s own behavior at the workplace Being at the workplace not only increases the risk of infection due to closer contact with fellow workers, it also brings together a variety of potentially divergent perspectives and behaviors. Our data indicate that people who pay less attention to rules and recommendations in their private lives only transfer this behavior to the workplace if their colleagues do not value protective behavior either. If, on the other hand, colleagues followed rules and recommendations, the individual behavior adapted accordingly.\nIt is especially noteworthy that we did not observe any effect in the opposite direction. Someone who strongly complies with recommendations in their private life also does so at work - regardless of whether colleagues protect themselves particularly well or not.\nThe following tool lets you interactively explore and understand our findings. Toggle the button to reveal the difference between groups in which the professional environment places a higher emphasis on rules and recommendations instead of having little emphasis on them. Tip: Pay special attention to the size of the difference within a group first, and then between groups.\nTool explainer: The grid shows two groups of people differing in their private protection behaviour (horizontal axis) and protection behaviour at work (vertical axis). The group on the left stated that they attach less importance to rules and behavioral recommendations in their private lives - in contrast to the group on the right. The further up a person is positioned in the grid, the more likely they are to follow rules and recommendations at work (horizontal axis).\tLessons learned: Role models safeguard our health Whenever people come together in a group, they influence each other’s attitudes and behavior. In order to foster protective behaviour, it is therefore not only important to communicate risks and recommendations. It can also be useful to highlight exemplary behaviour of colleagues and thereby communicate group norms that potentially increase protective effortsd in the whole workgroup. In particular, people who are less compliant with rules and recommendations in their private lives could thus be better protected in contagion situations.\nBonus: Free access to research data Our work ensures that the research we conduct can be checked and replicated.

The present study investigated the influence on pathogen avoidance of familiarity with other people at private gatherings. Based on the social identity model of risk taking and the theory of the behavioural immune system, we assumed that greater familiarity with others would make people feel more connected with one another and decrease situational pathogen avoidance. This could result in lower perceptions of the risk of contracting COVID-19 and fewer protective behaviours. Two experiments (n1 = 1022, n2 = 994) showed that the negative influence of greater familiarity on the perceived risk of infection and protective behaviour is explained by an increased feeling of connectedness and less feeling of situational pathogen avoidance. In an additional survey, the participants (n = 23,023) rated the quality of their past social contacts. The correlational analyses showed that the familiarity of the other person was more important in explaining variance in protective behaviours than attitudes toward those behaviours or the pandemic situation itself. Understanding the process that result in an explosive increase in infection after social gatherings can improve infection control in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Situational pathogen avoidance mediates the impact of social connectedness on preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Robert W.

Over 540,000 people from across Germany have participated since April 2020, for more than 120,000 individuals we were able to gather comprehensive records of resting pulse, daily activity, and sleep duration over a span of 2.5 years. Using specialized algorithms, our Fever Monitor and Nowcast have processed up to 120 million physiological and behavioral data points each day to detect anomalous movement and pulse patterns in the population and provide insights into real-time tracking the spread of possible infections with SARS-CoV-2. This data set, together with psychosocial data obtained from questionnaires, is well-suited to address a wide-variety of questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. For us to be able to make the most of this unique data set, we suspended active data collection as of December 31, 2022 in order to focus our efforts on diving deeper in our analyses. Your contributions have made this project a landmark milestone in bridging the gap between science and society, and we would like to thank you for that. As this stage of the project comes to a close, our team now shifts focus onto quantitatively evaluating the fever algorithm and comprehensively investigating the long-term consequences of the pandemic.\nTime for a general inspection Recent advancements in research technology, of which wearable-based monitoring your vital signs is one, usher a new age of digital health in biomedical research. These developments give rise to rapid changes, not only in the tools and approaches available to researchers, but also in the ways in which research is conducted. However, left unchecked, this rapid rate of scientific progress can lead to problems in reproducibility and validity. As such, after more than two years of active field operation, we are now subjecting our fever algorithm to a comprehensive evaluation assessing its validity as a real-time monitoring system for disease detection. To this end, we will be discussing methods and results of our work with the scientific community, taking into account the findings and frameworks of similar efforts such as findings from abroad. This enables us to evaluate the potential of our fever algorithm to be used as a sensor-based monitoring tool in future pandemics.\nFig. 1: Up-to-date version of the fever algorithm. If a person’s resting heart rate and step count deviate significantly from their baseline measurements and run counter to each other (“fever bump”), the algorithm signals a potential infection.\tKeeping an eye on the pandemic’s long-term consequences The other major focus in the coming months is the analysis of the “Long COVID and Pandemic Consequences” study launched in April 2022. We seek to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of changes in vital signs following infection with SARS-CoV-2, including the nature and magnitude of observed changes, time it takes to return to pre-disease baseline levels, what factors or circumstances might delay in this normalization, and potential consequences thereof. Initial analyses have already been presented to you in one of our past blogposts. In addition,, we will investigate questionnaire data in relation to vital signs. For example, is it possible to identify physiological correlates of self-reported quality of life by analyzing patterns in resting heart rate, activity, and sleep.\nFig. 2: In donors with confirmed COVID-19 infection, it takes about 2-3 months for the resting pulse to return to normal. In 2023, we plan to investigate this finding in more detail, especially with regard to the reported health-related quality of life. Read the latest news on the blog In 2023, the scientific work will continue unchanged even without further data collection. On the one hand, we will strenghten collaborations with various research groups to further develop our methodology; on the other hand, we continue to engage in better understanding vital parameters and different long-term consequences of the pandemic. To that end, we will remain active on this blog and familiar channels.

Using data from adults in Germany (N = 29,355) assessed between October 2021 and February 2022, we investigated factors associated with self-reported compliance in both private and working life and how these relate to each other. The results indicate that private compliance was stronger among older individuals and females; among those who worried more about the pandemic situation and assumed that infection was more severe; among those who trusted the government more; and among those who did not perceive public health measures as exaggerated. Private compliance was also associated with personality traits; in particular, individuals who followed regulations and recommendations were likely to be more introverted, conscientious, open, and agreeable. Compliance at work related to both private compliance and colleagues' behaviors. Individuals whose private compliance was high also complied at work. However, when private compliance was low, compliance at work aligned with colleagues’ behaviors; that is, compliance at work was high when colleagues complied and low when they did not. The observed effects were stable over time. In summary, they suggest that compliance with regulations and recommendations depends on individual risk perception, trust in government, perception of required or recommended measures, and social norms. To promote protective behaviors in contexts where larger groups gather (including workplaces), making positive social norms more salient (e.g., by supporting role models) may prove especially useful.","tags":[],"title":"From delta to omicron: The role of individual factors and social context in self-reported compliance with pandemic regulations and recommendations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Philipp Sprengholz","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665446400,"objectID":"7e6f71bcc01a609742b73da3991836be","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/open-data/teilds-erlebenverhalten2023/","publishdate":"2022-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/open-data/teilds-erlebenverhalten2023/","section":"open-data","summary":"The data provided here serves the purpose of reproducing all findings in the study titled *From Delta to Omicron.

Today, around 470 million donated data points on heart rate, step count and sleep provide us with a unique insight into the development of vital signs under pandemic conditions.\nTo give you a glimpse into our data analysis process and the amount of work that has gone into this project, in this article we touch upon some of the challenges we’ve faced over the course of two years of data donation. We further introduce you to a new tool for exploring these vital signals for yourself.\nWhat we were able to show last time In May 2021, measurement data from 2020 and 2021 were available for the same month for the first time. This marked a major milestone for our analyses: we were able to explore what insights can be gathered from this year-to-year comparison. In this blog post, we demonstrated some of the interpretations we were able to draw. For example, the weight gain of many people during the COVID-19 pandemic could be an explanation for the observed increase in resting heart rate during the year. Weather may also have a considerable influence on heart rate and activity patterns. However, one thing has become clear from many of our analyses to date: your donated data cannot just be analyzed independently, but must always be evaluated in the context of external, possibly interconnected circumstances.\nWhat is possible now? A year ago our scope was relatively limited. At that time, we were only able to compare the month of May across two years - a month that already tended to be associated with declining case numbers following the end of the winter waves since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. For periods with more prevalent infectious activity, we lacked year-to-year comparative values. Thanks to your donations, comparing for example seasonal influences (e.g. low temperatures and longer nights in winter) is now becoming viable. But: there are many more possible influences and signals that can be found in our data - and we want to give you the opportunity to take a look for yourself.\nTwo years at a glance The data donation project spans an enormous range of widely diverse events, such as New Year’s celebrations, school holidays, major sporting events such as the European Football Championship and the Olympic Games, but also COVID-related mobility restrictions or the latest summer heatwave. All these events are reflected in our records, with for example heat waves affecting heart rate, New Year’s celebrations altering sleep patterns, and winter months decreasing the step count of our data donors, even when roughly summarized regionally and temporally.\nOur analytics team studies new aspects of the dataset every day, and we want to actively share this process with you. Over the past few weeks, we have developed a tool to interactively visualize the vital data geographically over time: The Datenspende Vital Data Explorer. The data is averaged over a seven-day period and aggregated at least on a district level, ensuring that conclusions about the specific patterns of individual data donors are not possible. Today, we are excited to share with you a prototype of this data explorer tool. The tool is currently not optimized for mobile devices and will be constantly developed further.

How we assess the risk of infection, the methods we use to protect ourselves, and how we handle the pandemic in the future all depend on the answer to this question.\nFor several weeks now, Germany has been discussing a potential underreporting of its COVID-19 incidence rate. While more and more testing centers are closing due to lower summer demand, wastewater sample analysis and respiratory infection monitoring systems indicate increasing case rates. According to the current case definition, the reported 7-day incidence is based exclusively on PCR test results, while rapid antigen tests, whether performed professionally or at home, are not considered. Compared to rapid tests, PCR tests are often more accurate and ensure that local outbreaks can be detected correctly with a high degree of certainty. If the PCR test volume decreases, relative trends will still be visible, but the magnitude of new infections will be much more difficult to estimate.\nVarious research approaches are attempting to describe this degree of underreporting more precisely. Using questionnaire data from 28,274 data donors, in which we recorded test results and test types (e.g. PCR test, rapid antigen test), we aim to better estimate this situation by adding another piece to the puzzle.\nWhat does our data show? Our analysis consists of two steps: first, we compare how the official 7-day incidence differs from the “data donation” incidence based on your reported test results. Next, we examine PCR test rates over time to determine if a decline of this number is evident in our population and assess how it affects infection dynamics.\nTo get our analysis going, we first need to calculate the data donation incidence. For each day, we divide the number of self-reported positive tests via our App by the number of questionnaires submitted that day. From this, we calculate the 7-day average and multiply the result by 100,000. This enables us to estimate the number of cases per 100,000 donors and approximately compare our values to official statistics.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; echarts4r Fig. 1: Comparison of the official incidence (solid dark blue) with the “data donation” incidence (dashed light blue).\tWe observe that the two incidences evolve quite similarly until the end of the first quarter in 2022, although their magnitudes do in fact differ. Some of the variation can be attributed to the fact that our data donor population is not necessarily representative of the general German population (more on this later).\nApproaching June, however, the trajectories decouple from their former patterns. We hypothesize that this trend may be related to a decline in PCR testing. To investigate this further, we next looked at the ratio of PCR and rapid tests in our data set and compared it to the ratio of the two incidence curves shown above.\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; echarts4r Fig. 2: Incidence factor and rapid test ratio compared to PCR tests over time. The two curves show a similar trend.\tThe blue line shows by how many times the data donation incidence exceeds the official PCR incidence – we call this the “incidence factor”. In the first quarter, we see that our calculated incidence reflects, on average, about three times the official data. This value remains nearly constant throughout the spring, and may be due to higher than average test rates in our sample (thus resulting in more infections detected) or simply because our data donors are not representative of the German population as a whole.\nFrom June onwards, however, when we observe a change in the previously stable relationship as the two incidences increasingly decouple, the ratio between them grows larger. This means that the donated test data estimates a significantly higher incidence than official statistics. As a result, the data donation incidence factor increases. What is the reason for this?\nOne explanation could be the assumed decline in PCR testing. If fewer and fewer people confirm their rapid test result by PCR method, these infections are missing from the official statistics. To further assess this assumption, we calculated the ratio of rapid tests to PCR tests for each day (”rapid test ratio\u0026#34;), shown as the green line in the figure above. A value of 0.5 means that half as many rapid antigen tests as PCR tests were reported by our donors on a given day. If the value in contrast is 1, then exactly the same number of rapid tests and PCR tests were recorded. Values above 1 indicate more rapid tests than PCR tests.\nWe can see that both curves (incidence factor and rapid test ratio) show a similar trend. In the first quarter, the rapid test ratio remains at a similar level except for minor fluctuations. However, from the end of May onwards, we observe a strong growth in both curves — when more infections are reported with rapid tests instead of PCR tests, the data donation incidence differs more …","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"fe03bd1bb916177b49b2a73e9f08a0dd","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/questionnaire-incidence/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/questionnaire-incidence/","section":"reports","summary":"The question of how many new COVID-19 cases per week continues to navigate our political and personal decisions.

For this, we would like to thank you once again.\nDuring this time, we have learned that there is a great willingness to support science and research with health data from fitness trackers and smartwatches. Over 500,000 people have donated their vital data for at least a certain period of time and more than 38,000 people already regularly participate in our in-app surveys. Using your data, we were able to capture anomalies in vital data that is potentially related to COVID-19 symptoms and the frequency of those detections in the fever monitor maps well to the pandemic’s waves of infection.\nKeeping an eye on the long-term consequences of the pandemic In 2022, we are expanding the focus of our research and examine the long-term health consequences of COVID-19. In the coming months, we would like to investigate, among other things, how physical activity, sleep, fitness and mental health develop in individuals after the disease.\nFor this reason, we will launch a new study on Long COVID in the data donation app which is developed in close collaboration with the Long COVID group at the Robert Koch Institute. By answering monthly questionnaires, you will help us to understand potential long-term changes in vital signs after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, to determine the frequency of long-lasting or emerging symptoms, and also study the interaction between the two.\nNew research questions thanks to comprehensive vital data From your donated data we have already gained important insights into the potential changes of vital signs following the acute phase of COVID-19. In one of our recent blogposts, we were able to show that the average daily resting heart rate in COVID-19 positive individuals is elevated for months following an infection and normalizations may only happen slowly (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1: Average change in daily resting heart rate for COVID-19 positive individuals regardless of vaccination status using data until October 2021. Details on the calculation and results can be found here. Similarly, in preliminary analyses, we found that vaccinations can have a strong positive effect on the normalization of vital signs after contracting COVID-19 (Fig. 2). You can also find these results in one of our recent blogposts.\nFigure 2: Average change in resting heart rate (weekly aggregates) for COVID-19 positive individuals who bt the time of infection were either unvaccinated (red) or at least fully vaccinated (purple). Results are based on data collected until January 2022. Full details about this analysis are found here. From here, there are many other questions that we want to look at in the following months and that you can help us understand better. This includes, among others:\nWhat are the long-term effects of pandemic-related behavior change on the health-related quality of life? How long do people have diminished physical or mental capacity after being sick with COVID-19? How much do Long COVID symptoms, such as fatigue (persistent exhaustion), affect the activity and sleep patterns of recovered people? Study starts on April 4, 2022 The new Long COVID study is expected to be available in the Data Donation app on April 4. All donors will be notified via push notification once participation is open. New donors can find the app in the app stores of Google, Apple, and Huawei. To sign up for the study, you need to first add the study via the main menu, and then elect to participate.\nThe monthly questionnaires will only take a few minutes to complete. Already now, we like to thank all donors for their continued participation and support. As usual, we will share our results with you in this blog on a regular basis.\nIf you have not yet participated in our other sub-studies (Test, Symptoms and Life Situation and Experience and Behavior in the Pandemic), we would like to invite you to participate in these surveys as well.

For example, each week we ask how much our donors trust the federal government to properly handle the pandemic. The responses are measured on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely) and a total of 29,530 donors already submitted their responses. Since we recently received a request about this question according to the freedom of information (IFG) act we would like to share some information on that topic with you today.\nTrust varies with case numbers The following figure shows the mean daily responses over time. It can be seen that the average trust our donors have in the federal government has overall been moderate, i.e. between mostly and partially, with the main exception of November and December 2021. Average trust declined steadily with the increase of new infections in November, followed by a resurgence of trust in December when case numbers fell again. However, when the number of daily new infections increased again in January 2022 due to the Omicron variant, average trust in the federal government declined only slightly and levelled out with the reduction in case numbers in February 2022. The official change of government on December 8 2021, however, had little impact on the trust ratings.\nFigure 1: Trust in the federal government over time. The average value of trust of our donors is shown in red. The black line shows the number of new infections averaged over seven days, and the gray dashed line indicates the official change of the German government on December 8, 2021.\tThe changes can also be displayed as a bar chart. For example we can compare the responses for the last week in October 2021, November 2021 and February 2022, respectively: while 60% of respondents indicated to trust the federal government mostly or completely in the last week of October 2021, this figure dropped to 25% in the last week of November 2021. In the last week of February, their share rose again: 44% of the data donors mostly or completely trusted the federal government to properly deal with the coronavirus.\nFigure 2: Trust in the federal government in October and November 2021 as well as February 2022. Percentages are rounded to whole numbers. Conclusion and Summary Further analysis of the data showed that trust was slightly higher on average among male and elderly donors, however differences were small. In addition, participants with children under the age of 18 were somewhat less likely to trust the federal government than other donors. This might, in part, be caused by the particular burden placed on families over the course of the pandemic.\nFinally, it should be noted that the trust of data donors is not representative of the trust of the whole German population. For example, results from the COSMO study show that the trust of the general population is slightly lower than what we found in our donor population. Nevertheless, the donated data is of high value as the frequency of the surveys allows short-term changes to be detected and potentially be linked to other variables, such as changes in new infections, certain policies, or even personal burden.\nAs always, we would like to thank all our donors for their active participation in the data donation project as without your ongoing and regular support analyses such as this one would not be possible at all. In our next blog post, we will discuss a new relationship between vital and survey data and show how your donated data can be used to estimate COVID-19 case numbers based on machine learning.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"0a26b36e00b5d19e9cfd543127d3330d","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/trustgov/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/trustgov/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear donors,\nFor about half a year now, you have not only been able to donate your vitals and sleep data, but also to respond to various regular surveys about your personal experience and behaviour during the pandemic.","tags":["Experience and Behavior","Trust","Federal government of Germany","Informationsfreiheitsgesetz"],"title":"IFG Inquiry: How much do data donors trust the German government in handling the pandemic?","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Heart Rate","Activity","Sleep"],"content":"Update August 10, 2023: The findings reported here were published as part of a more extensive analysis in the scientific journal PNAS Nexus.\nDear Donors,\nin a previous blog post we showed how our vitals are expected to change over the course of a Sars-CoV-2 infection. We saw elevated resting heart rate, a large reduction in daily activity and prolonged sleep duration in the weeks following a positive PCR–test, all of which can be interpreted as signs of illness and an increased need for rest.\nThanks to your active participation in the data donation project and the corresponding surveys we now know the vaccination status of 25255 donors and the results of 16489 PCR tests (2149 of which were positive). Combining these data points allows us to discriminate between infections that took place before and after donors were at least fully vaccinated. For both groups (vaccinated \u0026amp; unvaccinated) we investigated expected changes in donated vital data compared to a two month period prior to an infection, i.e., typical values of sleep duration, activity and resting heart rate when users have, most likely, been healthy. This way, we hope to see what effects vaccination may potentially have on the long-term effects of COVID-19 that we observed in our earlier report.\nA word of caution before we dive into the analysis: By today almost all donors that provide vaccination status are either fully vaccinated or boostered. Whenever we talk about unvaccinated cases in the following we refer to users that caught COVID-19 prior to their vaccination. This is most likely because vaccines were not yet readily available by the time of infection of those donors. Almost all unvaccinated cases have been recorded in late 2020 and early 2021 (the second and third wave) while most breakthrough infections are recorded from fall 2021 onwards (the fourth and fifth wave). In this sense it is possible that the results below might also partially arise from distinct physiological responses to the different variants of Sars-CoV-2.\nResting heart rate changes are less severe for vaccinated donors Figure 1: Mean resting heart rate (RHR) change in Covid-19 positive individuals. We distinguish people that were unvaccinated when contracting the diseases (red) and those that were at least fully vaccinated by the time of infection (purple). For comparison we also show RHR changes of COVID-19 negatively tested donors. Since test data is only available with an accuracy of one week, the gray shading indicates the approximate time period during which tests were taken. The error bars indicate the variation (the so-called standard error) around the mean. Let’s start by investigating expected changes in resting heart rate (RHR) around the time of a positive COVID-19 test. For unvaccinated COVID-19 positive donors (red curve in Fig. 1) RHR starts to increase in the week prior to taking the test, which might be a precursor to an upcoming disease. The largest change is observed in the week of taking the PCR-test with an expected value of around 2 beats per minute above typical values. The normalization (indicated by a change of around zero) in week one has been observed in other studies as well and might be linked to what is called Bradycardia – a potential symptom of COVID-19. After this short period RHR increases again and then slowly returns to its normal value over a long course of 13 weeks.\nIn contrast, RHR-changes of vaccinated donors (shown in purple in Fig. 1) are comparatively smaller, with an increase of only around 1 beat per minute in the week of taking the test and a much faster return to normal values after at most 7-8 weeks. This implies that both, the severity of an infection in the acute phase reduces and the recovery process improves for vaccinated donors. Note that we can only display vital changes for vaccinated donors up until 9 weeks after an infection, since most cases have been reported from November 2021 onwards.\nActivity of vaccinated donors likely only decreases during quarantine Figure 2: Mean change in activity of unvaccinated (red) and vaccinated (purple) COVID-19 positive donors as well as COVID-19 negative individuals (blue) for comparison. A second metric that we often analyze in the data donation project is daily activity measured in terms of step count. For both,vaccinated and unvaccinated donors, this value decreases strongest in the week following a positive PCR-test, most likely due to staying at home as people isolate themselves. However, we note two subtle, yet important, differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases:\n(i) The activity reduction is almost twice as strong for unvaccinated donors in the week of taking the PCR-test. Hence decreases in activity likely happen much earlier than for vaccinated donors, probably already in the days prior to taking a test. It is reasonable to assume that such a reduction is already indicative of an upcoming illness and not only a response to quarantine orders which might not be …","date":1644364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691625600,"objectID":"b4f45624e3b2d9e75bc64124b64254c8","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/breakthroughinfections/","publishdate":"2022-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/breakthroughinfections/","section":"reports","summary":"In this analysis, we examine how vaccinations influence the impact of infections on resting heart rate, step count, and sleep patterns by contrasting infections prior to and subsequent to being fully vaccinated.","tags":["Heart Rate","Activity","Sleep","Breakthrough Infections","COVID-19 Vaccination","Quarantine"],"title":"Are breakthrough infections milder on average?","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Johannes Lemcke","Daniel Grams","Ilter Öztürk","Ronny Kuhnert"],"categories":["Sociodemographics"],"content":"Introduction In this blog post, we will give you further insight into the socio-demographic characteristics and the health situation of the data donors in the sub-study “Tests, Symptoms and Living Situation” (hereafter referred to as “sub-study”). This time we compare the educational level, the subjectively assessed health status and the utilization of general medical services of the participants in the sub-study with reference data. This brings us another step closer to the goal of describing data donors more precisely. Data donors in the sub-study are not representative of the general population, they registered themselves with the data donation app without having been randomly selected. This means that differences between the data donors and the general population are to be expected. We would like to further investigate in this blog post how strong these differences are with regard to the indicators mentioned.\nWhy do we compare the data donors in the sub-study with reference data? What does this have to do with Covid-19?\nThe comparison tells us whether the results of the questionnaire or the fever monitoring can be generalized to the overall population. Or, to put it another way, whether the effects that we record in the fever monitor would be expected to be less pronounced or more pronounced compared with the general population.\nEducational status To assess the educational background of the participants in the sub-study, we choose the Microcensus 2017 as a reference (source: FDZ der Statistischen Ämter des Bundes und der Länder, DOI: 10.21242/12211.2017.00.00.1.1.1, own calculations). For this purpose, we classify the educational and vocational training into three categories (low, medium, high education) according to the standards of ISCED11. When comparing educational status between participants of the sub-study and the Microcensus 2017, large differences can be seen in all three educational groups. As known from other surveys (i.e. survey study of the general population), we also see here that participants of the sub-study with low education are strongly underrepresented compared to the Microcensus 2017. This means that fewer people with low education participated in the sub-study than you would find in the general population. Also, from the group of those with a medium education, fewer people participated in the sub-study than would have been expected according to the Microcensus 2017. In contrast, significantly more people with a high level of education took part in the sub-study than would be expected in the general population. If we look at the distribution of education according to gender and age groups, we see similar results. There are stronger differences among women than among men. Moreover, the difference increases with age.\nLimitation: The distribution from the Microcensus 2017 refers to the population aged 18 and over. The data donors, on the other hand, can participate from the age of 16. In the 16-18 age group, a large proportion has not yet completed their school education. This proportion was assigned to the low education category. The proportion in the low education category would therefore actually be even larger if the distribution of the population aged 16 and over were considered. Unfortunately, we do not have this distribution. 16 (0.08 %) data donors did not provide any information on school-leaving qualifications and vocational training out of a total of 20,924 participants in the questionnaire “Living situation” (Last updated: 20.12.2021).\nTotal by Gender by Age Figure 1: Educational distribution of the data donors of the sub-study with Microcensus 2017\tSubjective health status/general health status For the evaluation of the subjectively assessed health status of the participants in the sub-study, we use the current population-representative health survey GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS of the Robert Koch Institute as a reference for comparison. Compared to the participants in GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS, the participants in the sub-study rate their subjective health status more frequently as very good or good and less frequently as moderate, poor or very poor. This observation is also reflected in the analysis according to gender, whereby the difference is more pronounced among women than among men.\nIf we look at the subjectively assessed state of health according to age groups, a somewhat different picture emerges. Participants in the sub-study aged 16 to 29 are less likely than participants in GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS to report a very good self-assessed health state. In contrast, they are more likely to report a moderately good self-rated health status than those taking part in GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS. Proportionally, participants in the sub-study aged 16 to 29 also report a subjective state of health rated as very poor slightly more often than participants in GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS, although these proportions are very low in both studies.\nIn the 60+ age group, a moderate, poor or very poor subjective …","date":1640044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640044800,"objectID":"1c2e45a1bac0382a9272b3dce21555be","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/benchmark/","publishdate":"2021-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/benchmark/","section":"reports","summary":"Introduction In this blog post, we will give you further insight into the socio-demographic characteristics and the health situation of the data donors in the sub-study “Tests, Symptoms and Living Situation” (hereafter referred to as “sub-study”).","tags":["Sociodemographics","Benchmark","Sample"],"title":"Comparison of data donors in the substudy on 'Tests, symptoms and living situation' with other reference studies","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Johannes Lemcke","Daniel Grams","Ilter Öztürk","Ronny Kuhnert"],"categories":["Sociodemographics"],"content":"Introduction In previous blogposts, we have already discussed the sociodemographics and spatial distribution of donors.\nIn this blogpost, we will again look at the sociodemographic composition and spatial distribution of donors. For the analysis, we will look at two selection levels each and compare them with the actual population composition (Census update, as of 12/31/2019). To do this, we look at sociodemographic and spatial distribution using three variables: spatial distribution at the state level (classified using the first three digits of the given zip code), gender, and age (recorded in categories of 10). In the first group, the data of the self-report at new registration of all data donors are analyzed, in the second group the data of the sub-study “tests, symptoms and living situation”. We would like to investigate two questions:\nHow much does the current sample of all individuals participating in the Data- Donation-App deviate from the true distribution in the population? How much do donors who participated in the “tests, symptoms, and living situation” sub-study differ from the overall donor sample? Regional Distribution In order to map the regional distribution of donors, we first look at the postal code of the donors. We assign these to the corresponding federal state. For reasons of data protection, we only collect the first three digits of the donor’s postal code (and thus no longer give a distribution at the county level). If we compare the spatial distribution within the federal states with the true distribution in the population (Figure 1, bar chart), we see different participation rates in the federal states. In the states of Hamburg and Berlin, we see that donors are disproportionately represented relative to the population distribution. For example, the value 0.41 of Hamburg indicates that, compared to the distribution in the population, about 40 percent more people from Hamburg are represented in the data donation sample than would be expected according to the population distribution in Hamburg. On the other hand, the states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony are clearly underrepresented. This distribution is also reflected when we look at all donors per 100,000 inhabitants per federal state (Figure 1, Map of Germany).\nFigure 1: Distribution of the total data donor sample calculated per 100,000 inhabitants in the federal states (map) and comparison of the federal state distribution of the data donor sample to the census as of 12/31/2019 (bar chart).\tWe see similar results when comparing the participants in the sub-study with the distribution in the population (Figure 2, bar chart). The distribution of the partial study almost matches the distribution of all data donation participants within the states relative to the population. Here, the relative distribution of partial study participants in the states of Hamburg and Berlin is also significantly higher than the distribution in the population. Here, too, the states of Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Thuringia are most underrepresented, closely followed by Saxony. This distribution is also reflected when we look at all donors per 100,000 inhabitants per state (Figure 2, map).\nFigure 2: Distribution of the sub-study sample calculated per 100,000 inhabitants in the federal states (map) and comparison of the federal state distribution of the sub-study sample to the census as of 12/31/2019 (bar chart).\tGender Distribution In the next step, we look at the gender distribution among all data donors and among the donors in the sub-study. At first glance, it is noticeable that male data donors are overrepresented and female data donors underrepresented compared to the total population. We see the same result for the participants of the partial study. Here we also see that the gender difference in the sub-study increases. In our old blog post on the sociodemographics of donors, we had to make a correction to the gender distribution. Already since the launch of the data donation app, more men than women participate in the data donation. Figure 3: Gender distribution of the data donor sample (census 12/31/2019)\tAge Distribution Essentially, we see a different age distribution in our data and the age distribution of the overall population. We see that both the participants in the data donation and the participants in the partial study are slightly underrepresented in the youngest age groups and strongly underrepresented in older age groups. Significantly overrepresented compared to the total population are the age groups from 30 to 59. The comparison between participants in the data donation and participants in the sub-study, shows minor selection effects. With regard to age, however, the participants in the sub-study are similarly distributed compared to all donors in general.

See end of this text for details.\nDatenspende 2.0 is finally here. Since mid-October you can answer short questionnaires in the app to help us to substantially improve our understanding of the donated vital data in relation to COVID-19. More than 12,000 people have already taken part and entrusted us with this information. For this we would like to express a heartfelt thank you right away.\nFor instance, in the ‘Tests, Symptoms \u0026amp; Life Situation’ questionnaire, we ask donors about the approximate time and result of their first PCR test. A total of 521 donors reported having a positive test in the past, 5353 donors submitted a negative result.\nIf we look at how often self-reported positive results occurred over time, you can see that this distribution fits very well with the course of the pandemic. We see the first wave in March 2020, the second and third wave in winter 2020/2021 and the fourth wave starting now. Conversely, we observe few positive test results in the summer months.\nProlonged changes in vital signs for COVID-19 positive individuals If we look at the physiological and activity data before and after a PCR test, we obtain interesting insights into the possible effects of COVID-19 infections. In particular, we calculate the mean change in resting heart rate, step count and sleep duration relative to the baseline period before the test, for both positively and negatively tested donors.\nLet’s first look at the resting heart rate. For donors with a confirmed COVID-19 infection, this value increases by an average of 2 beats per minute prior to getting tested. This is followed by a brief normalization period, which has been observed in a previous study, before spiking again and then slowly returning to baseline levels over an extended period of two to three months. In contrast, donors who tested negative show no significant changes over time. The shaded regions represent the so-called confidence intervals that indicate the uncertainty of the mean.\nWhen we look at activity patterns (measured by daily step counts), the influence of COVID-19 is even more pronounced. In the days preceding a positive test result, step counts begin to drop sharply, reducing activity by around 3500 steps per day on average. That’s equivalent to a decline of more than 50% of usual activity! This change lasts for up to a month.\nSleep duration is also affected by COVID-19. Around the time of diagnosis, our COVID-19 positive donors sleep an average of around 40 minutes more, which also takes about three weeks to return to normal.\nFor all three variables, similar findings have been reported in a comparable study of donated vital data in the United States. This shows that our results are by no means an exception, but are instead consistent with the current state of research.\nImproving the fever algorithm The donated data suggests that COVID-19 can produce prolonged changes in physiological and behavioral signals, particularly in the case of resting heart rate. Next, we will investigate this phenomenon in more detail and use these new findings to improve and validate our fever detection algorithm. In doing so, we will also take into account effects such as sociodemographics and life circumstances.\nIn one of our first blogposts we already discussed that the demographics of our donors are not fully representative of Germany’s general population and particularly senior citizens, one of the major risk groups for COVID-19, may be underrepresented in the data donation project. Thus, our observed effects may be even more pronounced than what we currently obtain from the donated vitaldata. Additional demographic information that we collect in the second questionnaire of the study ‘Tests, Symptoms \u0026amp; Living Situation’ should therefore help us to extrapolate the effects observed in the vital data more accurately to the whole population in the future . We would like to thank all donors for their continued support in our efforts to better understand COVID-19 through providing us with wearables data as well as entrusting us with vital personal information obtained via the questionnaires. We will continue to keep you informed of further progress here and report new insights made possible by the surveyological data as they become available.\nCorrection In an earlier version of the blog post we discussed a maximum change in resting heart rate of up to 3 beats per minute and a return period of up to three months. Likewise, a prolonged sleep duration of 60 minutes was reported. After writing this arcticle, we have improved our calculation to specifically account for seasonal influences, such as altered resting heart rate in winter, and increased activity as well as reduced sleep in summer. To make the results comparable to those in our later blogpost on breakthroughs infections , we adjusted the figures in this blogpost on April 11, 2022 by using our improved algorithm.

In the long term, the changes influence when and how much sunlight we get in our daily lives. This can have a variety of effects on our bodies and psyche, in part mediated by changes in our sleep.\nTherefore, today, we take a look at the sleep data of our donors during the last two clock changes.\nDaylight saving time, summer time, standard time, what time? Fig. 1: Shift in sleep timing between DST and winter time. Shown is the average daily midsleep time over the full course of the Data Donation - measured in local time (top) and in standard time (bottom). The weekly peaks reflect the later sleep on weekends, the large central peak is caused by New Year’s Eve. Looking at the bottom graph one can see that sleep is essentially almost an hour earlier during DST. The top graph shows that sleep in local time appears nonetheless slightly later because the shift in sleep timing is not exactly a full hour. Standard time, the time in effect during the winter months, is the regular time in our time zone. For Daylight Saving Time (DST), also called summer time in some regions, the clocks are then set forward by one hour, meaning we pretend that it’s already one hour later or that we live in a time zone further east.\nSo DST means that work and schools essentially start one hour earlier. And most of us react to this by shifting our sleep forward.\nThis shift is also quite obvious in our donors’ data: measured in standard time, their midsleep, the midpoint between falling asleep and waking up, was on average almost one hour earlier during DST than during standard time (Fig. 1, bottom). Looking at the same pattern in local time (Fig. 1, top), however, you can hardly make out a difference between summer and winter. Hardly? Indeed, because a closer look reveals that the shift in sleep did not fully compensate for the one-hour clock change, so that sleep during DST appears on average a few minutes later (Fig. 1, top).\nThe 2021 spring changeover - unusual pattern during unusual times? Normally, the spring changeover is the “more difficult\u0026#34; one. When we change from standard time to DST, we usually “lose” an hour of sleep, since work or school starts essentially an hour earlier from then on.\nThis spring, however, the changeover seems to have been quite smooth on average (Fig. 2): Although the donors slept less on the night of the changeover, the following 2-3 weeks they slept actually more than before. This is unusual, because previous studies have shown that the first week of DST is usually marked by sleep loss in the majority of people.\nFig. 2: Sleep duration around the start of DST. Shown in purple is the sleep duration over 4 weeks before and after the changeover. The solid line shows the daily value, the dashed line the mean value over several weeks before and after. Apart from the shorter sleep on the Sunday of the changeover (compare with the expected duration in red), there is an unusual increase in sleep duration after the changeover to DST - probably driven by the Easter vacations following the changeover and the pandemic situation at that time. What was going on in Germany in the spring of 2021? Easter break started directly after the changeover in 3 federal states and one week later in nearly all others. In addition, there were the Easter holidays themselves and the third Corona wave during which the home office rate was 24-31% according to surveys. Maybe that’s why some of the donors didn’t have to get up a whole hour earlier after all?\nA look at the wake-up times supports this hypothesis (Fig. 3): the donors woke up “only” 40 minutes earlier on average in the 3 weeks after the changeover - probably because a significant part of them did not have to adapt immediately and completely to DST.\nFig. 3: Wake-up times around the start of DST. Shown in blue is the wake-up time over 4 weeks before and after the spring changeover. The solid line shows the daily value, the dashed line the mean value over several weeks before and after. Wake-up times became essentially earlier with the start of DST (standard time, dark blue), but at first only by half an hour, making wake-up later in local time (DST, light blue). This suggests that some of the donors did not (have to) adapt to the new time and explains the unexpected increase in sleep duration after the change illustrated in Fig. 2. The fall changeover 2020 - later is earlier? In the fall, we get back the hour that we “lose” during the spring. Work and schools start an hour later again, so most people can get up later. …","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"333c13a2eab33d24bd7d9a97dbc075a4","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/clockchange/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/clockchange/","section":"reports","summary":"This weekend it’s that time again: The clocks will be changed back one hour, from daylight saving time to standard time.\nSince the beginning of the Corona Data Donation, this is the third clock change.","tags":["Sleep"],"title":"Clock change","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["App update","News"],"content":"Dear donors, After several months of preparation, it is finally here: Corona Data Donation 2.0, through which you can participate in scientific studies on the consequences of the Corona pandemic as of today. In these studies, we will regularly ask you to answer short questionnaires on specific topics, voluntarily of course.\nThe app update is available from the Google Play Store if you have an android phone, from the Apple App Store if you are on iOS, as well as from the Huawei App Gallery.\nBy updating to Corona Data Donation 2.0, we want to allow you to participate more directly, improve the data on which our scientific work is based, and create a way to evaluate the results so far.\nSupport science you find important The update initially unlocks two studies in the app, and we are already working on more in the background. It is important to note that we will only offer you studies in which we see a clear added value, and that participation always remains absolutely voluntary.\nThe first study “Tests, symptoms and living situation” will help us to further improve the algorithms of the fever monitor, as well as to detect possible signs of long covid disease in the data. Participants:in the study will be asked to provide further information on socio-demographic characteristics, health status and behavior in questionnaires. These data will also help us understand which groups are participating in the data donation project - and which may not. In the second study, “Experience and Behavior in the Pandemic,” we are collaborating with the COSMO study scientists led by Cornelia Betsch to understand individual exposure and risk perceptions, as well as individual behavior in the pandemic.\nBetter science thanks to better data Using data from the surveys, such as if and when you had a covid infection, or were vaccinated, we can improve our results in two ways.\nThe first is to evaluate and improve previous results, for example, detections in the fever monitor. For the detections, we use our algorithm to look at a person’s vital signs - resting heart rate and step count - and estimate whether a Covid disease might have been present during the period under consideration. With your help we can compare the result of this estimation with the result of the survey - and check directly how well our algorithm works.\nTime slice of resting heart rate and step count that our algorithm marked with “probably fever”. By donating data 2.0, we can now evaluate if this is true, and improve the algorithm if necessary.\tThe second improvement through data donation 2.0 is answering new questions. In one of the recent analyses, we looked at sleep duration in the pandemic and found that there is a gender difference here. But to what extent is this due to different (gendered) experiences of the pandemic? Or is it always present completely independent of the pandemic? In the second study “Experience and Behavior” we want to answer these and other questions. The following graph shows the nationwide sleep duration in hours by age and gender. How much of the difference might be due to men and women experiencing the pandemic differently?\nWe hope that many of you will be as eager and committed to helping us with Data Donation 2.0 as you have been in the past - and that together we can answer some old and new questions more accurately than before.\n","date":1634601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634601600,"objectID":"11c9c143a7d1755056c4452edd0b5856","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/release20/","publishdate":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/release20/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear donors, After several months of preparation, it is finally here: Corona Data Donation 2.0, through which you can participate in scientific studies on the consequences of the Corona pandemic as of today.","tags":["App update","News"],"title":"The data donation 2.0 is here","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Marc Wiedermann","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Fever Monitor","Nowcast","Heart rate","Activity"],"content":"Dear Donors,\nFor the past year, our fever monitor has compared two distinct signals: The detections of anomalous vital signs and weekly incidences of COVID-19. Both signals have unique advantages and disadvantages when it comes to monitoring current trends of the pandemic:\nThe incidence curve describes the overall state of the pandemic very well, but due to lags in reporting of numbers, is only really reliable up to a couple of days in the past. Our fever curve instead can provide a real-time monitoring (with no reporting-lags) of current physiological and physical stress, but also picks up on other signals not necessarily related to COVID-19, such as acute respiratory diseases, including influenza-like illnesses, or even changes in weather conditions. A nowcast based on vital-signs Today, we explore how to exploit the advantages that come with both sources of information for a short-time monitoring of the pandemic’s current state. Specifically, we encompass the history of the pandemic through the detection rate of anomalous vital signs and the (reliable) incidences from the previous week. Combining this historic information with the current detection rate thus potentially enables us to provide a so-called nowcast of COVID-19 incidences.\nBelow, you can see a first comparison of our proposed monitoring system with later confirmed incidences. For testing purposes we have restricted ourselves to all available data until the end of July. The gray dot indicates our nowcast for the last week of July for which reliable incidence numbers were not yet readily available by the time of testing our monitoring system.\nWeekly nowcast based on the fever curve and comparison to officially reported average COVID-19 incidences per week.\tYou see that in hindsight our (still) comparatively simple monitoring system matches the reported incidences quite well. It even correctly picks up the turning points of the second and third wave!\nUnique advantages Even though the numbers do not match up exactly, our new approach has unique advantages that make it a promising complement to existing nowcasting methods:\nThanks to the informative power of the vital data, we only require three single data points (detections and incidences from the last week and detection from the current week) to provide an estimate of current incidences. Therefore our methodology could in the future be used from the very start of a pandemic situation. The system is automatized and can in the future work in real-time such that it provides continuous updates once new information becomes available through our donors with no delays in reporting. It adapts to the current state of the pandemic and estimates how many cases we expect for each fever detection depending on whether we are in a phase with low or high incidences. Outlook We will now continue to evaluate and improve our vital sign-based nowcasting scheme which thanks to the help of you, the donors, provides an additional data-driven methodology to assess current trends in the pandemic. For this purpose we will next update our systems so that your donated data will be processed as fast as possible once it becomes available to us. We have already included the new nowcasting method into our fever monitor to give you a better impression of how your data is used to further improve the understanding of the current pandemic.\n","date":1628640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628640000,"objectID":"463e8331954e7e3072fe015b697f237a","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/nowcast/","publishdate":"2021-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/nowcast/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear Donors,\nFor the past year, our fever monitor has compared two distinct signals: The detections of anomalous vital signs and weekly incidences of COVID-19.

To live up to the trust you’ve placed in us, we continue to adapt the project to best serve public health needs throughout the ongoing pandemic by exploring new use cases as they become relevant depending on the current situation. Right now, most of the team is busily working on a new version of the Datenspende app that will allow more direct interaction between the team and you.\nAt the same time, we also want to continue to present our project results in more detail to you. So in this report, we will pay special attention to the fact that we now have over one year of data collected. This is a significant milestone, because it allows us to draw longitudinal conclusions from the data and share those with you. So, today we will compare the data from May 2021 to data from May 2020 and see what insights one can generate from this. Take a look at the figures below.\nResting heart rate Looking at the regional average heart rate in the month of May, we can see a general trend of higher resting heart rate in 2021 compared to the previous year. This elevation in heart rate is observed in all the federal states and for Germany overall, with an increase of 1.2 bpm. It is interesting that we see this despite colder temperatures and higher rainfall in 2021, ruling out the effect of hot weather raising the population’s heart rate like we saw last summer. Looking at the pandemic situation, May 2020 and 2021 are both located at the downward trend of infection waves, but with restrictions still in place.\nOne interesting difference is that according to polls, 40% of people reported gaining an average of 5.6kg over the last year. It is unsure whether this is the reason for the increased heart rate, but it is well understood that increased weight and reduced fitness results in a higher resting heart rate.\nStep count Looking at the step count of May 2021 vs 2020, we do not see a huge difference. There is a very slight decrease of 60 steps nationwide. The obvious reason for the reduced activity would be the weather and rain conditions forcing people to spend more time inside compared to last May. But the effect is rather small so there are not many conclusions we can draw from it.\nSleep duration When we compare sleep in May 2021 to May 2020, we see a decrease in average sleep duration in each of the federal states and in Germany overall, with a nationwide loss of 4 minutes of sleep. Several studies indicate that over the course of the pandemic, especially early on, sleep duration increased compared to previous years. Therefore, one could postulate that May 2021 reflects a return to historical norms as the pandemic sleepiness wears off. Also interestingly, the same studies found that the degree of change in sleep was correlated with the degree of improvement in resting heart rate. Now we observe an increase in heart rate as sleep duration decreases.\nOutlook As you can see, making concrete assertions of how specific results came to be is rather difficult given the very dynamic nature of the pandemic and the data we collect. Nevertheless, we are glad that we are now able to dig into long-term developments thanks to your donations. Please stay safe and healthy, get vaccinated if you can, and stay tuned for upcoming announcements and updates!\n","date":1627603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627603200,"objectID":"104639437ece715bc2a0c63fa032673c","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/oneyearofdata/","publishdate":"2021-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/oneyearofdata/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear donors, When this project started in April 2020, we did not expect hundreds of thousands of people to donate their health data for more than a year - your participation and continued willingness to support this project has exceeded our boldest dreams.","tags":["Heart rate","Activity","Sleep"],"title":"One year of Datenspende data","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Annika Rose","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Fever Monitor","Heart rate","Activity"],"content":"Dear donors, In this report, we will take a closer look at the detections we have observed over the course of the last year and compare the fever curve to other existing COVID-19-related public health data.\nIn order to more clearly visualize trends in the data, the following figures show the curves generated by aggregating the detections by calendar week. Correspondingly, we will be updating the online fever monitor within the next few days to display these weekly detections from now on.\nWeekly detections compared to COVID-19 cases Weekly detection rate stratified by age groups. Comparison to officially reported COVID-19 case counts in respective age groups.\tIn this first figure, we look at the breakdown of detections by age group compared to new confirmed COVID-19 cases per week. Of the active donors, the overwhelming majority fall within the ages of 35 to 59 at nearly 65% of donors, while the 15-34 age group is the least represented, containing only 10% of regular users. The remaining 25% belong to the 60+ group.\nIt is important to note that only 53% of active users have provided data pertaining to age and gender, so our estimates must be taken with a grain of salt. Regardless, the detection curves for these groups all show decent correspondence with the age-stratified case counts. Predictably, the least represented youngest age group shows the highest inconsistencies.\nIf we look at detections by gender, we see similar agreement with trends in the reported COVID-19 case numbers, but keep in mind that our donor population is biased towards the female population who make up 60% of our donors.\nWeekly detection rate stratified by gender and compared to officially reported COVID-19 case counts.\tIf we look at the regional distribution of the detections and our donors, we find that 89% of our donors are found in western Germany compared to 82% of the actual German population.\nWeekly detection rate in Western and Eastern Germany compared to confirmed case counts\tFor more details on donor demographics, including a comparison of the age and gender distribution of the donors to the German population, please see our earlier post here: Donor demographics.\nComparison with other data sources Next, we compare the overall weekly detection curve to three data sources:\ni) the confirmed case counts, as before, ii) the test positivity rate, and iii) the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care. Comparison of weekly detection rate vs COVID-19 case counts, test positivity rate, and number of ICU cases\tIn all curves, we can see similar trends, characterized by two distinct waves, peaking around December 2020 and April 2021. While the case counts appear to be in a phase with the detections, the test positivity and ICU data are clearly shifted forward in time. Upon closer inspection, preliminary analyses suggest that the detections precede all three measures. If these findings hold true, a rise in detections may predict a rise in cases. We are currently evaluating the extent to which these detections can improve nowcasting estimates from current surveillance measures, which can be delayed by 1 to 3 weeks.\n","date":1625184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625184000,"objectID":"801f2b03c6fc26123371e721a15e9eb3","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/detectionscompared/","publishdate":"2021-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/detectionscompared/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear donors, In this report, we will take a closer look at the detections we have observed over the course of the last year and compare the fever curve to other existing COVID-19-related public health data.","tags":["Fever Monitor","Heart rate","Activity"],"title":"Detections compared","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Eva Winnebeck","Annika Rose","Hannes Schenk","Paul Burggraf","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Sleep"],"content":"Around a quarter of you donates not only their daily heart rate and steps but also their sleep data, particularly how long and when you sleep. Since sleep provides a wealth of information on health and well-being, we are now taking a closer look at these data - enlisting also the expertise of sleep researchers.\nOur analysis of the sleep data has two main aims: First, we would like to understand how sleep is changed under the pandemic - because of lockdowns, home office and psychological burden or distress. We hope that this will provide indications about general well-being and health during the pandemic as well as side effects of pandemic measures. Second, we want to further improve our fever monitor based on the sleep data. Someone who is acutely sick usually sleeps more than before. We seek to make use of this effect in our real-time monitoring of COVID-19 cases in Germany.\nIn this blog post, we would like to introduce the sleep data in general.\nHow do we sleep? Sleep has multiple dimensions. Among those most easily measurable are sleep duration and sleep timing. Sleep duration refers to how long one sleeps; sleep timing refers to when one sleeps i.e. the midpoint between first falling asleep and the final wake-up. Both sleep duration and sleep timing change with age and differ between women and men. This is also the case in the data from the donation-data:\nSleep duration Sleep duration: You can see that young donors sleep on average the most and with increasing age, sleep gradually shortens. Across most ages, women sleep slightly longer than men. The group showing the shortest sleep duration are 60-year-old men with 6h 59 min. In contrast, the group of 20-year-old women sleeps on average half an hour longer at 7h 30min.\nSleep timing Who is the most pronounced night owl, can fall asleep only late and has trouble getting up in the morning? No surprises here: the teenagers and young adults show the latest sleep timing also in the donation-data (shown is the sleep timing on weekends). With increasing age, sleep becomes earlier and earlier, so owls slowly transform into larks. Generally, men tend to be more owlish than women i.e. sleep later. The earliest midsleep time is exhibited by 70-year-old men at 03:40. In contrast, the latest midsleep time, over one hour later, can be seen in 20-year-old men at 04:50. If one assumes a fixed sleep duration of 8 hours, a young man would sleep on average from 00:50AM to 08:50AM on his weekends, whereas a man well advanced in years would sleep rather from 11:40PM to 07:40AM.\nSleep timing is regulated by a body clock - set by light When and how we sleep is not our free decision but subject to strong biological regulation. Our body clock, also called circadian clock, provides our body with an internal time-of-day: during the biological night, our body is programmed for sleep, during the biological day, it is programmed for wakefulness. The circadian clock is mainly set by light - the best and strongest light for synchronisation is sunlight.\nThe donation-data show quite nicely that our sleep is indeed influenced by sunlight. There is a clear pattern from East to West in sleep timing. In the East, where the sun rises and sets earlier, people sleep earlier on their free days (weekends and holidays) than in the West, where the sun rises and sets later (around 4 min per longitude).\nThe cities stand out from this pattern: Here, sleep timing is significantly later than in the surrounding, less populated areas. Several studies indicate that this is at least partly due to lower daylight exposure in densely populated areas. A weaker light signal leads to a delay in the circadian clock and thus also in sleep timing. If opportunities for evening leisure activities also play a role is not clear, however, during pandemic times, there are much less such opportunities…\nThe town Sömmerada in Thuringia shows the earliest sleep timing with an average of 03:12. The people in the city of Mainz in North Rhine-Westphalia sleep almost a full hour later with an average of 04:11. For this comparison, however, one needs to take into account also the differing demographics between the regions.\nLiving and sleeping in 2 time zones: jetlag at home without any travel Much stronger than the East-West pattern, however, is the workday-weekend pattern in sleep timing. This can be seen also in the plot of the daily sleep timing in the donation-data: on weekends, donors slept not only longer but also much later than during the week.\nThe strong weekly pattern shows also interesting deviations: on public holidays in May and June, and most strongly over Christmas and New Year’s. As expected, the latest mid-sleep time was on January 1st at 05:29 after New Year’s celebrations. The earliest sleep timing was found at 02:47 on the day after the change from Daylight Saving Time to standard time at the end of October. This means a difference of 3 hours in average sleep timing across the year!

However, until now the Fever Monitor has continued to deviate from the case counts starting around the beginning of the new year. In this post, we will try to explain why we think this happened and introduce to you our updated algorithm.\nWhat happened? To recap: The Datenspende fever detection algorithm uses resting heart rate and daily step count data from fitness-tracking devices to identify patterns that are characteristic of fever symptoms. We know that increased resting heart rate in addition to decreased physical activity can be indicative of fever, so our algorithm is designed to establish baseline levels of these metrics for every individual and detect deviations from them. When a person’s resting heart rate is significantly elevated at the same time that their daily step count is significantly decreased relative to a threshold defined by how much their measurements tend to vary, a detection is triggered. The fever monitor represents the overall rate of detections across all users over time.\nBecause fever is one of the core symptoms of COVID-19, the official case counts have been the primary point of reference for our fever detection curves. However, the goal of the data-donation project algorithm is to provide an estimate of the current fever incidence in the population, not to replicate the COVID-19 case counts. Fever can be caused by other illnesses, such as the flu and respiratory infections. However, the strong, observed deviation can not be explained by other sources of fever alone.\nThe influence of weather During the summer of 2020, a sudden heatwave caused an initial decrease in heart rate followed by a large spike, while activity levels remained rather stable. This challenged the algorithm because the baseline period was defined as a few weeks beforehand. After the drop in heart rate, suddenly all measurements were way above their baseline. Now, it seems the other way around. After a sudden drop in heart rate and activity levels following the start of the lockdown, step counts have been gradually increasing since the beginning of the year, while the resting heart rate has been relatively unchanged. Take a look at the averages over time:\nThe average resting heart rate over time The average step count over time To fix our summer anomaly, we implemented both a normalization to combat abnormal weather effects as well as a longer baseline period for the heart rate. Why the longer baseline period? With the short baseline, brief deviations due to external factors significantly affect this baseline, which, overall, is relatively stable, as you can see in the figure above. Then why are we facing this problem now?\nWhat was the problem? In the figure showing the step count over time, you can see a long sine wave pattern corresponding to the different seasons. Our longer baseline doesn’t work in this case because, in the winter months, everyone tends to have a lower step count, which, as stated above, is one of the key factors of our algorithm. These changes aren’t due to abnormalities, but a distinct seasonal change spanning multiple months. Thus, if we compare this week’s step count to the one you had 3 months ago, you will likely see a strong deviation. But what if we only looked a few weeks back? This would give a more accurate idea of one’s current activity levels and be able to better detect quick deviations from it.\nBetter tracking of covid-19 case numbers So we changed exactly that. We shortened the length of time for computing the baseline for step count while keeping the long baseline for heart rate. We also put a stronger weight on heart rate, as it is our primary measure and our detections should reflect this. As a result, the fever detection algorithm no longer is affected by external conditions and now aligns much better with the COVID-19 case counts:\nWe keep improving The data-donation project is the first of its kind, so it has a strong experimental component and requires occasional improvements of underlying algorithms. In the weeks to come, we expect that additional modifications of the algorithm will become necessary as we refine our methods more and more. Some of you have noticed we removed the individual curves for the federal states. We took this step because we wanted to focus on correcting the trend for the nationwide curve first. We still have the plan to provide regional curves in the future again, but we probably have to aggregate some of the lower population states. If under a certain limit of donors per region, the detection rate turns out to be skewed and does not provide the necessary level of information we intend to share.\n","date":1614729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614729600,"objectID":"d3c22912c880343678bbb3f8e7f277bc","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/improved-method-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/improved-method-2/","section":"reports","summary":"Dear donors, since the middle of December, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany until the end of February.

Noteably, the curves now appear smoother, without the charactistic up-and-down modulations that were previously seen on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The reason behind this change is that we are now using an improved version of our fever detection algorithm for the Monitor.\nDuring the past weeks, we have been working hard to refine the detection algorithm. One of our key goals was to account for the impact that weather and temperature have on heart rate and activity, and subsequently the performance of the algorithm, by removing the influence of seasonal variations.\nBecause the COVID-19 case counts in Germany follow the improved fever detections substantially better, we would like to take the opportunity to share in what ways we improved the algorithm.\nDetektions and Case Counts First, let’s have a look at the case counts compared to the detection curves for Germany and its federal states identified by the improved algorithm.\nThe national fever curve and case counts for Germany and the Federal States: Die nationale Fieberkurve und Fallzahlen in Deutschland und den Bundesländern: For each day, we computed the rate of detections using the revised method.\tWe found that the detections generated by the data donation project predict the temporal evolution of the case counts remarkably well. We can see that in the decline part of the first have during spring, the constant plateau during the summer, and the beginning to the second wave this fall.\nWe can also see this for the individual states, but not to the same extent because here the detection numbers are so low that statistical fluctuations dominate the signal.\nWhat did we change? During the past months, we have been working continuously on improving our methods. We always check the performance of these methods by comparing to different data sources and applying a variety of quality checks. For example, we use the RKI data on influenza like illnesses as a benchmark in addition to COVID-19 related data, such as the case counts, positive test rates and other measures.\nSeasonal effects We previously discussed the impact of weather on heart rate in the Blog Post Great weather quickens the heart. The goal is to account for this impact and not have the results skewed by it.\nOur original method is derived from a number of publications that dealt with detecting fever during flu season. One of the fundamental differences between these studies is that we have a lot more data in terms of the total length of time of more than 5 months. Over this period, seasonal effect begin to play an increasingly large role. The magnitude of the effects were unavailable when we started in spring 2020.\nIn the improved algorithm, we investigate the vital data of each donor not as an absolute value, but rather relative to the data of all donors on that day. We then compare these values with the average values of the donor, the donor’s so called baseline. This way our algorithm automatically adapts to external factors like weather and climate and the impact of these on the detection curve is substantially reduced.\nCalculating the Baseline We also changed the method in which we calculate the donors’ baseline. In the previous iteration of the algorithm, we computed the baseline from 28 days prior to the reference day. Originally, with a much shorter timeframe and minimal seasonal effects, we had some success in eliminating minor external effects. But as our dataset expanded over several seasons, this approach proved unable to effectively account for substantial seasonal effects. Now, with the new method we use the data from the entire time window to compute the baseline, making it more stable as time goes on and less susceptible to external factors.\n","date":1602892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602892800,"objectID":"694a3a1161a06d89184d0da342592397","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/improved-method/","publishdate":"2020-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/improved-method/","section":"reports","summary":"During the past few weeks we have been updating our Fever Monitor on a daily basis, based on the heart rate and activity data measured by the wearable devices and smart watches of more than 520.","tags":["Fiebermonitor","Aktivität","Ruhepuls"],"title":"Feverish reloaded","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Annika Rose","Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":["Fever Monitor","Activity","Heart rate"],"content":"The Corona Data Donation Project is designed to detect fever symptoms in the time-series of the donors’ daily resting heart rate and daily step count signals. See blog post “How does it work?” for the mechanics of how the whole thing works and the basic idea behind it, or check out some of the preliminary results we obtained in the past.\nIn the context of the current covid-19-pandemic this is important because fever can be one of the symptoms of covid-19. So, if we detect an increase in the proportion of donors with potential fever symptoms this might be an indicator that covid-19 infections are on the rise as well.\nBut does it work? One way to check this is comparing the time course of the new daily confirmed covid-19 cases in Germany with the estimated cases of fever in the community of donors that we detect and compute with our algorithms. If both curves have similar shapes as a function of time, if they follow similar “ups” and “downs”, it is an indication that it works. The figure below illustrates the comparison:\nCovid-19 reported cases and fever detections: The two curves depict the confirmed covid-19 cases (red) compared to the fever detections (blue) computed from the donors’ data. The dashed lines and dots represent daily data, the strong solid lines indicate the trends in the curves. Because the fever detections are only proportional to the covid-19 cases, only the shape of the curves matter, not their offset.\tWe see in the figure the complete time-series of confirmed cases of covid-19 in Germany from early March to late August. Superimposed is the detection rate of fever as computed from the Corona Data Donation Project. Note that the detection curve only covers a period starting in late May. Although the whole project started in April, in order for detections for work, a 4-5 week baseline has to be computed prior to the detection period. Because fever detections are only proportional to covid-19 cases, the vertical offset of the curves is not so important. Rather, the shapes of the curves matter, so how similarly they behave as time advances.\nBottomline: Both curves seem to follow very similar trends which is an indication that the fever detection algorithm seems to be “picking up the covid-19-signal”. This is good news. But keep in mind, this is a first shot using the approach and there’s still room for improvement. But as a preliminary results this is quite promising.\nLet’s take a closer look and zoom into the most recent dozen weeks or so:\nCovid-19 reported cases and fever detections: The two curves depict the confirmed covid-19 cases (red) compared to the fever detections (blue) computed from the donors’ data during the last 14 weeks. The dashed lines and dots represent daily data, the strong solid lines indicate the trends in the curves. The time course of both curves are similar, the detection curve seems to precede the confirmed cases by approximately a week.\tThe figure above depicts the same comparison of covid-19 cases with fever detections during the last few weeks. When we compare the covid-19 case count (red) with the fever detections we see that important features, such as the continuous increase of cases throughout July until mid August 2020 are captured by the detections. Futhermore, the detection curve seems to precede the confirmed cases by a week. This could imply that we see a signal in the detections before covid-19 cases are reported in the system. If this is so, the whole Corona Data Donation Project could become a valuable tool in detecting trends in the pandemic in Germany early on. However, we really need to run more tests to see whether this result is robust and not mere coincidence.\nFever does not equal covid-19 This is all good news, but remember that the Corona Data Donation Project is designed to detect fever symptoms and cannot identify covid-19 disease directly. There are many other infectious diseases and ailments that have fever as a generic symptom. Our algorithms cannot (yet) diffenentiate between different infections that induce fever in a person, so it is important to check whether the fever curves that we measure are not dominated by other diseases like influenza like illnesses or acute respiratory diseases.\nThe figure below compares the confirmed covid-19 case count and the computed fever detections with surveillance data on influenza like illnesses and acute respiratory diseases monitored in by German GrippeWeb platform.\nCovid-19 confirmed cases, influenza like illness and acute respiratory disease incidence in Germany: The curves here depict different possible determinants of fever dynamics in Germany. The comparison suggests that the measured fever detections are not dominated by influenza like illnesses or acute respiratory diseases because the fever detections show no significant correlation. The correlation with covid-19 confirmed cases is significantly higher, especially during July and August 2020.\tThe data in this plot aggregates data by week. …","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"42cf82ce7f0f5a6b6ae0d6128ee1de5f","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/c19detect/","publishdate":"2020-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/c19detect/","section":"reports","summary":"The Corona Data Donation Project is designed to detect fever symptoms in the time-series of the donors’ daily resting heart rate and daily step count signals.

In this post, we not only want to give you an update on the national fever curve, but also want to show the results we obtained for the individual federal states in Germany.\nRecall: In this project, we evaluate the time series of daily averages of resting heart rate and daily step counts of individual donors. When, if compared to individual baseline values in both quantities, the resting heartrate increases and remains elevated for a few days while simultaneously the step count drops and remains low for the same number of days, that anomaly is an indication that a person is sick and has developed a fever. Here’s a figure from the last post that illustrates a typical candidate for a positive detection:\nResting heart rate and daily step count of a potential donor with fever symptoms: This donor has a typical baseline of 3,500 steps per day and a typical resting heart rate of around 73 beats per minute. The heart rate rises and remains higher for a few days while the step count decreases simultaneously.\tThe deviations from individual baselines are computed for all donors with sufficiently long data streams and are automatically identified with the detection algorithms we developed.\nUpdate: Fever curve for Germany The following figure depicts the fever curve for Germany as measured by our detection algorithms. The way detection works is explained in detail in the post Feverish. Currently we are using two different detection algorithms (labeled A and B) that are based on two different measures of statistical deviations from the baseline central tendancy. Both algorithms produce functionally similar curves.\nThe national fever curve based on resting heart rate and daily step count: For every day in the depicted time period, we computed the daily detections from resting heart rate and daily step anomalies. The fever curve aggregates these detections on a national level. The dashed lines represent the trend in the progression with a systematic increase in detections in July.\tIn the time period from May 26th - Aug. 3rd, 2020 we measured the detection rate, so the fraction of detections with respect to the analyzed donor cohort. The detection rate is typically in the range of 0.01-0.06 so between 1% - 6% are “diagnosed” with fever. We see two different important qualitative features in the curves. First, we see clear temporal modulations in the curves with a typical period of around 2 weeks. We were able to find out that these modulations correlate with variations in outside temperature that exhibit approximately the same periodicity. We will discuss this topic in one of the next blog posts.\nMore important, however, are the trend lines. In the trends that ignore the short time variations, we see a systematic increase in fever detections in July. Or course, we cannot conclude from this that this increase is caused by COVID-19 cases. Because we “only” measure fever symptoms and not COVID-19 symptoms directly, the observed trend can also be caused by other infections of diseases that yield fever symptoms. This is why it is important to compare the measured curves to results obtained by other surveillance systems. This is explained in detail in the previous blog post Feverish.\nFever curves of federal states in Germany By now we can compute the fever curves for the 16 federal states in Germany individually. Our goal is to fine-tune the geographic resolution and compute fever curves on a county and city level. At the moment, however, we do not see a sufficiently large number of detections on a county level.\nThe next figure depicts the fever curves for individual federal states.\nFever curve of individual federal states: The figure depicts positive detections in a chosen state. You can use the menu below to select each state. The two curves, again, represent the result of the two detection algorithms we developed.\tInterestingly, the fever curves of individual states do not vary much apart from slight variations. All curves follow the overall national trend.\nThis effect can be seen more distuinctly the fever curves of all 16 states are depicted in one figure. This is shown in the figure below, which also depicts the national aggregated fever curve for comparison.\nThe fever curves of individual federal states compared to the national fever curve: This figure depicts the fever curve of individual states by color. The national curve is shown in black. Again, you can select individual states by clicking on the name of the corresponding state in the bottom legend.\tWhat’s next?

Although this sounds simple, the process actually requires quite a number of computational steps that must be aligned and implemented. So bear with us.

When we conceived and launched the project about three months ago we thought that we could use the daily donations of resting heart rate and daily step count to detect the onset of fever in donors which in turn would help us quantify changes in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic because fever is a symptom of the infection. Details of the underlying scientific idea were discussed in the blog post How does it work?.\nAlthough the task is straightfoward conceptually, the devil is in the detail. We had to perform a whole series of performance tests, check the algorithms, optimize parameters of the detection, deal with gaps in the data, make sure confounding factors, like climate, weather, holidays, and weekly modulations of the donors’ vital signals, geographic variation, etc. wouldn’t skew the results. Many of the necessary analyses were discussed in previous posts and lead to interesting scientific findings that were initially outside of the scope and intention of the project.\nWell, today we share with you the first solid results concerning the detection of fever in Germany based on the Corona Data Donation Project.\nWe computed the first fever curve. The results below are still preliminary and they may change in the future as we optimize the detection algorithm. But it’s safe to say now, we believe, that we are “seeing a signal”. This whole thing seems to be working.\nWhat signals are we looking for? Let’s recap what we are after: Many donors have donated long stretches of daily resting heart rate and daily step count data by now. For every donor we would like to detect deviations from their normal values. For example a sudden increase of resting heart rate and persistence over a few days could be a fever symptom. So first we need to determine the “normal” values, the so called baseline. In order to get a viable baseline we need quite a number of days of data because naturally all vital signals are fluctuating.\nOrdinary baseline behavior Resting heart rate and daily steps without any unusual patterns: This donor has a typical resting heart rate and step count. Both time-series fluctuate a bit, but there are no systematic, unusual deviations.\tThe plot above illustrate the time course of resting heart rate (RHR) and daily steps for a donor that does not exhibit any unusual deviations from the baseline values. Over the entire observation period, the curves are, apart from small, irregular fluctuations, flat. Note that the RHR fluctuates less. Step counts are modulated more strongly. This is why we had to look into these quantities and the expected variation in detail in the preliminary analysis, discussed in blog post: The Pulse of the Nation and Step by Step.\nProbably not the right signal Compare this now to a donor who does exhibit unusual deviations shown in the plot below.\nResting heart rate and daily steps with a bump: This donor has a typical resting heart rate and step count. At the end of the observation period, we see a strong and systematic increase in both signals that evolve in parallel. This is probably not a donor with fever symptoms. More likely: A person that started an unsual activity, e.g. a hiking or bike trip or related holiday activity.\tThis person has a typical RHR of around 55 beats per minute and typical daily step count of around 5000 steps per day. At the end of the observation period there’s a sudden increase in RHR to a value significantly higher than the baseline. Remember that these numbers are daily averages. Could this be an indication of fever? Probably not, because the increased RHR is accompanied by a rise in daily steps. So potentially this is a person that went on holiday or does sports for a period of time. People that have a fever potentially are more likely to also have a reduced step count, and not a significant increase.\nDetections Now have a look at the time series of the two donors below. Both exhibit a clear and well defined deviation in resting heart rate, the “fever bumb” that persists a number of days. At the same time the daily step count decreases over the same period. This period also lasts a significant number of days. So the hypothesis is that these may be candidates for “sick and in bed with fever”.\nResting heart rate and daily steps with a plausible signal: This donor has a typical resting heart rate of around 65 beats per minute and typical daily step count of around 10.000. At the end of the observation period, RHR increases, peaks, and decreases again over a period of a few days. Simultaneously, the steps decrease systematically to around 4000 steps over that period. Note that this user also has a data gap for a period in mid May.\tResting heart rate and daily steps with a plausible signal: This donor has a typical resting heart rate of around 73 beats per minute and typical daily step count around 3500. Heart rate bump and step count dip coincide.\tOf course there could be different explanations for this …","date":1594252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594252800,"objectID":"b5b1f8b9fc0f4cdf13722ca9bb900d52","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/fevercurve/","publishdate":"2020-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/fevercurve/","section":"reports","summary":"Remember the goal of the Data Donation Project?

Many of these things can influence the vital data of our donors; for example, lifted lockdowns, bank holidays and good weather may lead to more sport activity and could potentially lead to a high resting heart rate.\nOne of the big challanges of this project is the identification and correct handling of those numerous other factors.\nA good example of a factor that might influence vital data is weather.\nWhat do we expect? The weather influences the vital data on multiple levels. On one hand can good weather change our behaviour. If donors are more active on days with good weather, this should influence their step counts in particular. So far it’s just common sense.\nOn the other hand it is known from previous studies, that temperature has a direct influence on our heart rate. At pleasant room temperature our heart rate is the lowest. If we’re cold or sweating, our heart rate increases slightly.\nOf course the outdoor temperature is not necessarily the temperature that our body directly experiences.\nRain and Clouds Lead to Less Activity Weather, of course, has many aspects: temperature, precipitation, wind speeds, cloudiness, and many more. Their influence on the vital data is diverse. Clouds and sunshine influence our behavior but have no direct influence on our body:\nResting heart rate and step counts as a function of cloudiness and precipitation: The resting heart rate of the donors does not correlate with cloudiness and precipitation. But the step count does: the donors walk less if the sky is cloudy or when it’s raining. All data points are daily aggregates.\tHere are the mean resting heart rates and step counts plotted against the cloudiness and precipitation (locally weighted depending on donor density). Since weather is just one factor of many, the plots appear quite noisy (e.g. the values are higher on weekends). The lines (linear regression) are supposed to provide guidance and show the general trend in the data. We see that the resting heart rate is completely unaffected from the cloudiness and precipitation (horizontal regression line) but that step count decreases slightly with more rain and clouds (falling regression line).\nTemperature Influences Resting Heart Rate Temperature has a much clearer influence on the heart rate:\nResting heart rate and outdoor temperature Left: The daily aggregated resting heart rate depending on the outdoor temperature. The regression line rises, so on average the resting heart rate increases with increasing temperature. Right: The same values sorted by date. The temperature is encoded by color. We can see the correlation persists during the entire observation period.\tThe resting heart rate correlates clearly with outdoor temperature. We do not see a heart rate increase for low temperatures. One reason could be that we show the daily average of the temperature, the daily maxima are respectively higher. Also heating and wRM clothes might compensate most of the effect of low temperatures.\n","date":1594104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594104000,"objectID":"243709b491bfba67605c3f7ac51b0fc7","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/weather/","publishdate":"2020-07-07T08:40:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/en/reports/weather/","section":"reports","summary":"Many things have changed in the last few months; the number of active Covid-19 cases and local Corona-regulation, but also everyday things like the weather.

This time we are reporting on the demographics of the donors, including age, gender, height and weight, which can be specified in the app.\nA subset of donors (about 10%) provide voluntary information on age, gender, body size and weight in addition to their daily heart rate and step count. This data is not required for our work on COVID-19 but yields important information about how significantly the donor community deviates from a representative sample.\n08.12.2021 In an earlier version of this blogpost we said that more men participate in the data donation than men. This was a mistake, in fact the ration is about 60% men and 40% women. You can find more information on donor demographics in our new report.\nAge distribution The age distribution in our data is consistent with the age distribution of the total population, with a few deviations. The average age in Germany is 48 years, while the donor average is around 3.6 years older. This is due to an under-representation of young adults (age 20-35) combined with an over-representation of middle-aged adults (age 45-60). One possible reason for this disproportionate participation is age-related differences in risk perception. Young people may view themselves as less at risk of COVID-19 infection than people over age 45 or may not view the risk as severely. Another explanation may involve differential income distribution. Fitness tracking devices can be expensive, which may mean that they are more likely to be used by middle-aged adults who have a higher probability of higher income than young adults.\nIf we look at regional age distribution, we see that, not only is our overall donor population slightly older than the national average, but this same trend is exhibited by the individual federal states. Interestingly we see systematic differences between federal states.\nAge and gender groups A combined analysis of gender and age shows that women in our donor population are slightly younger than the national average, while male donors are slightly older. The average age among men is 50.2 years, which is about 4 years older than the average age for women (46.4 years).\nWhat’s next?

Together with the resting heart rate, the step count is an important parameter for this study. As you can read in our post, The Pulse of the Nation, deviations from the average resting heart rate could indicate fever. However, resting heart rate may also deviate for various unrelated reasons.\nBy taking the step count into consideration as well as the resting heart rate, we can obtain a stronger indicator for fever: If your daily step count is much lower than your average step count, while your resting heart rate is significantly higher than baseline, it is more likely that fever is the underlying culprit. Thus, we obtain stronger results when combining step count and heart rate in our analysis.\nHowever, before combining both parameters into one analysis, the step count itself needs to be analyzed on its own. By doing this, important variations due to weekday patterns or weather factors can be identified first. Moreover, step counts may even vary regionally between rural and urban areas. Taking all this into consideration, we aim to establish a solid reference baseline for further analyses.\nStep count statistics for Germany and the federal states To determine the typical daily step count and variation of donors in Germany, we plotted the the distribution of average daily step counts for all of Germany and each of the federal states:\nDaily step count in Germany and the federal states. The step count of all donors from April 4, 2020 and May 18, 2020, is shown above. Indvidual states can be selected via the lower menu panel. We can see that the number of steps does not appear to differ significantly between federal states. Rather, it follows a national trend.\tAs can be seen in the figure above, typical daily values fall between 5,000 and 7,000 steps, with a fairly broad variation. Some donors even show a significantly higher step count. Variations between different German states, on the other side, are rather insignificant, leading to a uniformly shaped step count curve.\nThe step count map Similar to the Resting Heart Rate Map, we can determine the average step count per district in Germany. The result is shown in the following map.\nDaily average step count map. We calculated the average daily step count for each German district and found regional variation between 6,500 (light green) and 8,500 (dark green) steps per day. Typically, donors in rural areas take more steps per day on average than donors in urban areas.\tThe map depicts the average daily step count, computed for each district during the period from April 12 to May 18, 2020. The variation around the mean extends between 6,500 and 8,500 steps a day. In some regions, e.g. in Thuringia’s Kyffhäuserkreis and Schmalkalden-Meinigen, the step count is significantly elevated compared to the nation-wide average daily step count. Also, there is a clear difference between urban and rural areas in general. Donors in urban areas tend to take less steps a day than donors in rural areas.\nTemporal stability of the step count parameter Now, let’s look at the temporal stability of the step count. The below figure depicts the average step count for all of Germany as a function of time between April 12 and May 18, 2020.\nNation-wide average step count as a function of time. The green line represents the average daily step count within a time frame of a couple of weeks. It is situated between 6,000 and 7,000 steps per day. The shaded region marks the confidence interval of daily step counts, i.e. the region in which all individual step counts fall. Weekends are indicated by the grey shaded regions.\tWe can see that the daily step count follows roughly a constant curve. However, long-term tends cannot be predicted. The daily average is between 6,000 and 7,000 steps. Compared to the average daily resting heart rate, the step count displays higher variation (see Figure 2 in this post)). Moreover, weekends, especially Saturdays, are more prone to higher step counts than other weekdays.\nAverage daily step count in German states Now the question arises whether the number of steps of the donors differs regionally. The figure below shows the average daily step count of donors for each of the German states.\nAverage step count in German states. The average step count for each German states is represented by a colored line. Individual states can be selected in the menu panel. It can be seen that weekends, marked by the grey shaded regions, show an increased step count, particularly on Saturdays.\tIn this figure, we can see that donors walk or run more frequently in some states as compared to others. In Hamburg and Bremen, for instance, the average step count is typically lower, whereas donors in Thuringia and Saxony are more “on-the-go” than donors in other states.\nIn addition, this figure clearly shows that the average …","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"b90c2bc3e1695beae6b86df5f19417da","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/schritte/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/schritte/","section":"reports","summary":"The distribution of daily step counts In addition to the daily average resting heart rate, we can obtain the daily step count from connected wearable fitness devices.

Since an increased heart rate could be a possible indicator for fever, which alone is a core symptom of COVID-19, the resting heart rate marks the basis for this study. More on this topic can be found here.\nEach day, every connected device delivers information about a donor’s resting heart rate. By collecting this information for a number of days, we can establish a baseline resting heart rate for each donor. Because these values vary under normal conditions, we calculate this reference baseline on an individual-basis. This way, as we receive more and more data, we will be able to detect sytematic deviations from a normal resting heart rate that is unique to each person.\nThe distribution of the average resting heart rate Because resting heart rate is our reference point, we need to better understand how this value varies amongst our donors. In short, what is “normal”?\nThe figure below depicts the distribution of the average resting heart rate over all donors. It shows that values vary roughly between 40 and 90 beats per minute.\nNation-wide average resting heart rate: The daily average resting heart rate is determined for each donor. This baseline follows a nicely shaped Gaussian distribution with values between approximately 40 and 90 beats per minute.\tUsing this, we can further determine the average resting heart rate over all donors:\nNation wide average heartrate: 60,94 beats per minute However, one must take into account that the community of donors is not representative of the entire nation.\nTemporal stability of the baseline Naturally, people behave differently in different situations, i.e. on weekdays or weekends or holidays, which has a natural effect on their heart rate. This effect shall be taken into consideration when analyzing the above described baseline. The figure below describes the nation-wide average heart rate as a function of time\nAverage resting heart rate as a function of time: The nation-wide baseline, aggregated over all donors, is represented by the red line, whereas the red shaded regions show the variability within the population, i.e. the width of the distribution in first figure.\tWe can see that the nation-wide average resting heart rate at 60,94 beats per minute is nearly constant over the given time frame. In addition, the individual variabilty appears fairly consistant.\nA nation-wide resting heart rate map We can examine the regional variation of this baseline resting heart rate by averaging the values of users in each administrative district in Germany. The results are shown in the map below.\nRegarding the community of donors, we can map the resting heart rate for each administrative district in Germany. It shows, values are roughly distributed between 58 and 64 beats per minute.\nThe average resting heart rate map: This map depicts the color-coded average resting heart rate for each administrative district in Germany. The heart rate varies roughly between 58 and 64 beats per minute on average. These variations appear to be minor, but they are of high importance to this study.\tWe can see from this map that resting heart rate differs regionally. These differences are snall, but systematic and not by coincidence. In urban areas, the resting heart rate appears consistently lower than in rural settings. Also, we typically see slightly higher values in eastern Germany.\nThe reasons behind this phenomenon may be multifaceted, yet, are not the focus of this study. The average resting heart rate as a baseline, however, constitutes our most important measure in computing a nation-wide Fever Map.\nNote that we cannot yet identify potential COVID-19 Hot Spot regions nor provide information about possible cases of infection or fever from this resting heart rate map What next? With the map of the average resting heart rate as a reference, we can now analyze local and temporal deviations. This map is one of the most important intermediate steps on our way towards the Fever Map, which we are currently working on. Further results and intermediate steps are described in our subsequent posts.\nIn our next post, we will determine the average daily step count of our donors. Most fitness trackers measure daily step count as an indication of daily activity. So, in addition to heart rate, the step count provides us with another important signal.\n","date":1588464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588464000,"objectID":"14e85d1166c9685b45208a6ccd0c3b4b","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/pulse/","publishdate":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/pulse/","section":"reports","summary":"The most important vital signal in our analysis is the resting heart rate.

Regional biases, for instance, need to be identified and considered in further analyses. Moreover, we must ensure that enough donors are registered in each district so that statistical evaluations are valid and the anonymization gained through the regional consolidation is guaranteed.\nThe donors in Germany As of (16.06.2021), 538.174 donors have successfully registered their fitness wearables with our Corona Donation App. That is an average of 1.304 donors per district. Nationwide, we have a total participation of around 6 donors for every 1000 people, which is significantly more than we initially anticipated.\nThe particication in different districts As mentioned above, we need to first check whether donors are geographically representative in our sample. Additionally, the method of aggregating from ZIP level to district level must be verified, since ZIP codes, which are used by donors to identify their location, in Germany do not necessarily merge perfectly into federal districts.\nUsing this approach we generated the following map showing the regional distribution of donors in Germany:\nThe Donor Map: Distribution of donors across Germany. On average, we have 1.304 donors per dictrict. In urban areas the number of donors can be substantially more, e.g. in Berlin, 25,091 donors registered at least one device (as of 16.06.2021). Use your mouse to zoom in or out. Double-click to reset the perspective.\tFrom the figure above, we can assume that we have a solid data basis, where each district contains a sufficient number of donors.\nDistribution of donors per district The number of donors per district varies quite a bit from the number of inhabitants per district. In some districts, only a few 100 people decide to donate, while in other districts, more than 20,000 donors have registered. It is expected that a higher population produces more registered donors. The figure below illustrates the frequency of participation per district. On average, a district has around 1.304 donors.\nDistribution of donors per district. This histogram shows how distribution of donors differs between districts and what the typical value is.\tSince federal districts are populated to varying degrees, we anticipate a donor count that varies with inhabitant count. The relation between number of donors and inhabitants per county can be represented in a scatter plot like the one shown below. As expected, we observe a nearly linear relationship, indicating that participation does indeed increase with in proportion the the population size of a district.\nDonor participation vs. inhabitant count: Each data point represents the relation between donor count (ordinate, y-axis) and population size (abscissa, x-axis) per federal county.\tDonors per capita In total, 538.174 donors are currently participating with a nationwide population of around 83.02 million people. This means that about 0,56% of German people are donating their data, or about 6 donors per every 1,000 people.\nTaking this into account, it still needs to be investigated whether differences and geographical heterogeneities exist in the per capita donor participation. In other words, how does this per capita participation vary across counties? The following map answers this question.\nThe Donors per Capita Map: This map depicts the color-coded per capita donor participation, i.e. the number of donors per inhabitant of each county. You can see that certain regions show a significantly higher participation rate than others.\tThe number of donors per inhabitant is very important to consider in for further analyses. The fact that the per capita participation is not spread uniformly across the country needs to be taken into account in order to avoid any biases.\nThe question then arises whether the per capita participation is dependent on the inhabitant count. In other words: Does the population of a region determine the number donors per inhabitant? The scatterplot below depicts the per capita participation vs. the inhabitant count for each district. Despite regional differences, we can see that the relationship between the per capita participation and the population size of a district is weak and highly variable.\nPer capita donor participation vs. population size: Each data point corresponds to a district in Germany. The correlation of percapita participation and population size, displayed in logarithmic scales, appears to be very weak.\tRegional donor distribution vs. COVID-19 prevalence The important question now is whether the degree to which people agree to participate in the corona data donation project correlates with the local COVID-19 prevalence. In other words, is participation determined by the local and regional situation?\nThe following figure depicts …","date":1588377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588377600,"objectID":"281459117c24577e76eb3fb8fa1a5b4a","permalink":"https://corona-datenspende.github.io/en/reports/users/","publishdate":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/reports/users/","section":"reports","summary":"Here we go: Our first intermediate result - The Regional Donor Map.\nPrior to developing the anticipated fever map from aggregated heart rate information, we need to get a good understanding of the geographical distribution of our donors.","tags":["Sociodemographics","Maps"],"title":"The Donor Map - regional distribution and statistics","type":"reports"},{"authors":["Dirk Brockmann"],"categories":null,"content":"By registring your wearable fitness device to the Corona Data Donation App, you are directly contributing to currently ongoing research.

By merging your information with other data sources, e.g. official registration data, we can paint a better picture of how the virus may spread.\nHow does it work? Sensors, like accelerometers, temperature and optical sensors, are built into your fitness tracker to determine health and fitness related activity. The Data Donation App collects this information and stores it safely and anonymously on our server, allowing us to access the crowd-sourced data.\nA key measurement in our analyses is the resting heart rate, which describes how often your heart beats within one minute when you are at rest.\nMultiple times a day, your resting heart rate is derived by your wearable device from several measurements. By looking at these measurments over time, we can determine your baseline average resting heart rate, which may vary from person to person. However, if your measured heart rate is significantly or temporarily higher than your baseline average, it could be due to fever, which is one of the key symptoms of COVID-19.\nOf course, an elevated heart rate is not necessarily indicative of fever. Physical activity also causes an increase in heart rate. Therefore, we will analyze activity data, such as daily step count, along with resting heart rate.\nMoreover, the duration and quality of sleep can be derived using the combination of motion sensors and pulse detectors. Changes in sleep behavior can also be used to identify symptoms of COVID-19 infection.\nAll in all, by combining information from multiple sensors, we may be able to draw scientific conclusions that increase our understanding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWho invented it?
